string_help_text1 Bygfoot is a very intuitive and simple game, so there isn't a full-grown documentation. However, if you have trouble, there are a few places to go.

string_help_desc At the Bygfoot forums you can report bugs, ask for help and discuss the game (you don't have to register):
string_help_url http://bygfoot.sourceforge.net/forum

string_help_desc If you feel you've found out something about the game that has to be shared, you can add it to the Bygfoot Wiki:
