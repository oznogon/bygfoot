I'll rate the list below so that you know when (if ever) to expect the
described changes and features.


Priority
-----------
PPPPP very high, i should work on it very soon
...
P very low, i'll only work on it if i've done all the other stuff

Implementation
----------------
DDDDD very difficult, great changes in the code are inevitable
...
D very easy, takes only a quarter of an hour at most

High priority doesn't necessarily mean the feature will come soon,
because it might be very difficult to implement.
On the other hand low priority doesn't mean it'll take forever until
it's done, because it could be something that's very easy to implement.

The TODO list:

- make finances a bit better-looking and add summaries at the end of a season P DDD

- make player names sound more like the country they play in P DDDD

- add team badges somewhere (not in the main window, probably) P DDD

- add prize money for best players at the end of a season P DD

- add news feature: each week there's some news like 'last chance for
  Real to win the title!' or so P DDD

- add a junior section to the user's team (invisible); depending on
  the amount of money you spend on it, young talents might come into
  your team more or less regularly P DDD

- add possibility to borrow/lend players PP DDD

- enable closing the live game window while the game's still on P DD

- show average attendance in stadium capacity percentage PP DD

- add 'country' file for the world (based on the fifa rating list
  perhaps) P D

- add reasons for a player having been banned (grammar?), just like
  for injuries P DD

- change country file system: i'd like to have only two files instead
  of the current 6 or 7, one with all the leagues (Premier Division,
  Bundesliga etc.) and another that consists of sections, each
  describing a country. A new country could be created by simply
  adding a few leagues to the first file and a country definition to
  the second file. PPP DDDDD

- make leagues and cups more flexible and customizable (number of
  teams/groups etc.) PPP DDDDD
