.SS NAME
\fBBygfoot\fP \- a football management game for Linux and other Unices.
.SS SYNOPSIS
bygfoot [\-e|\-\-editor] [\-d dir] [\-f file] game
.SS DESCRIPTION
This man page documents version 1.5.0 of \fBBygfoot\fP. \fBBygfoot\fP is a 
small and simple football (a.k.a. soccer) manager game featuring some of
the world's most important leagues and cups. You manage a team from one 
such league: you form the team, buy and sell players, get promoted or 
relegated and of course try to be successful.

The game is deliberately kept simple. Players have only one value that 
reflects their playing ability, namely their skill value (they have 
some other values, though, like age or position). The only thing that 
you have to do besides managing your players is to look after your 
stadium: keep / make it safe and see that you have enough capacity.

Because of the simplicity of the game, and because most buttons have
tool\-tips you won't need much help while playing.
.SS OPTIONS
\-d [dir] \- allows you to choose another directory to search for
pixmaps and text\-files. Defaults to $HOME/.bygfoot.

\-f [file] \- allows you to choose a custom country file instead of one
of those included with your \fBBygfoot\fP release.

\-e \-\-editor \- allows you to start directly the team editor.	

[game] \- allows you to load directly a previously saved game. If the game
is saved to $HOME/.bygfoot/saves/ you don't need to type the full path,
only the file name.

any other argument is interpreted as game.
.SS FILES
/usr/share/bygfoot/support_files/ \- directory containing icons and images
used by the GUI.

/usr/share/bygfoot/support_files/text_files/ \- directory containing the 
built\-in country files, team definitions and other text data.

/usr/bin/bygfoot \- the standalone executable (depends on GTK+2).

/usr/man/man6/bygfoot.6 \- this manpage.

$HOME/.bygfoot \- user configuration directory.

If you've compiled \fBBygfoot\fP yourself, the files are probably in
/usr/local/ instead of /usr/.
