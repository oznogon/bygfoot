As of versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.1 there's an online update script called
'bygfoot-update' for the source package, located in the directory with
the configure script. In theory, users using the source package
shouldn't have to download new versions anymore, they can simply use
the update script to keep their version up-to-date.

Type bygfoot-update -h (or --help) to see the options the script
accepts.

You need an internet connection and the programs sed, tar, bzip2, wget
and patch to be able to use the script. If you have these, do the
following:

1. Connect to the internet.
2. Call 'bygfoot-update'.
3. Enter the directory of your source package (default is PWD).
4. Enter a temp directory you have read/write access to (default is
'/tmp').

Now the script tries to find out your revision number and package type
(stable/unstable) from the file 'revision_number' in the package
directory. Then it retrieves a list of available revision patches from
the Bygfoot homepage and asks you whether to apply those which are
new.

You can also use the script to download (or update) the official team names
and some edited teams (i.e. with real player names) which were removed from
the official packages since 1.7.2 and 1.6.2. To do so, call the script with
'bygfoot-update -c'.

There's a GUI frontend for the script. You can invoke it by calling Bygfoot
with the '-u' option or by clicking on 'File -> Start Bygfoot Online Update'
in the game.

I hope this will work well. The idea is great (isn't it?) but I don't
have a lot of experience with such things. If you find a bug, contact
me.
