working on: generating the fixtures at the beginning of a season.

current tasks:
implement a function 'file_check_home_dir' in file.c that checks whether
the files and directories that should be in the user's home dir are there;
if not, they get created/copied.

list of dirs:
$HOME/.bygfoot
$HOME/.bygfoot/saves
$HOME/.bygfoot/definitions
$HOME/.bygfoot/names

list of files:
$HOME/.bygfoot/definitions/{any xml files found in the support_files/definitions directory}
$HOME/.bygfoot/names/{any files found in the support_files/names directory}

the function should get called in main_init in main.c.
