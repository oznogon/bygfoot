<H2>Distributions</H2>
<P>
There are a few Unix/Linux distributions that include <B>Bygfoot</B> in their
repositories. In such a case, it is recommended to use the distribution specific
installing method, since it keeps your system clear and your package manager
informed about installed packages.
</P>
<P>
In case you know of other distros including <B>Bygfoot</B>, please
<A HREF="feedback.html">email me</A> so that I include them here.
</P>
<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H3>Debian / Ubuntu</H3>
<P>
Debian branches include various <B>Bygfoot</B> versions. Stable has the old 1.8.0
version currently, whereas 1.9.1 is in testing and the latest versio, 1.9.2,
is in unstable. Generally, the latest <B>Bygfoot</B> version gets uploaded to
Debian within a few weeks after the release at most.
</P>
<P>
To install <B>Bygfoot</B>, edit your <CODE>sources.list</CODE> file appropriately and execute
<CODE>apt-get install bygfoot</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
I usually also upload the deb package created by the maintainer to the
SourceForge.Net project site. If you want to install the game using this package,
you have to type <CODE>dpkg -i package.deb</CODE>. However, this won't resolve dependencies
like <CODE>apt-get</CODE> does.
</P>
<P>
Ubuntu includes  <B>Bygfoot</B> in the <I>universe</I> repository (last time I checked
they had the very latest version). After adding <I>universe</I> to your sources,
you should be able to install the game with <CODE>apt-get</CODE> just like with Debian.
</P>
<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H3>Gentoo</H3>
<P>
Last time I made a new release, it got included in Gentoo's portage the same day (without me
doing anything -- in the case of Debian, I usually email the maintainer of the <B>Bygfoot</B> package).
</P>
<P>
Right after a release, the package is masked in portage (naturally), but it becomes 'testing' after
a few days.
</P>
<P>
To install, call <CODE>emerge bygfoot</CODE> (after making the appropriate adjustments to your portage
configuration files if necessary).
</P>
<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H3>SuSE</H3>
<P>
SuSE doesn't include <B>Bygfoot</B> in official releases; however, I usually provide RPM and SRPM packages
with <B>Bygfoot</B> releases -- they should work on your SuSE system, provided you have the necessary
supplementary packages installed (GTK+2, mainly).
</P>
<P>
There's also a Belgian guy who regularly makes SuSE packages when I release new versions
(so I guess my RPMS aren't that perfect). I don't know how long he'll kept this up (I don't know
him at all), but anyway, <A HREF="http://linux01.gwdg.de/~pbleser/pnews.php">here's the link to his page</A>.
</P>
<P>
To install an RPM (this applies to other RPM-based distributions, too), call
<CODE>rpm -Uvh bygfoot-XYZ.rpm</CODE>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H3>FreeBSD</H3>
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> also gets regularly ported to FreeBSD by Pav Lucistnik. However,
I don't know how installing packages on BSD systems work, so you're alone
there.
</P>
<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H2>Windows</H2>
<P>
Since <B>Bygfoot</B> is a GTK program, you first need the GTK+2 runtime environment
for Windows. You can get it 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121075&amp;package_id=132255">here</A>
(you need the .exe 32-bit Windows version).
</P>
<P>
After installing the runtime environment, you can download and unpack the <B>Bygfoot</B> Windows
package, switch to the game directory and start the game.
</P>
<P>
Of course, you don't have to reinstall the runtime environment to be able to
play later <B>Bygfoot</B> versions, you only have to do it once (you only have to
update the RE if some newer <B>Bygfoot</B> version uses functions only available
in newer GTK+2 versions).
</P>
<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H2>The binary package for Linux (Unix?)</H2>
<P>
This might be the easiest way to try out <B>Bygfoot</B> on a Linux x86-system.
</P>
<P>
The binary package is a simple tar.bz2 archive containing everything you need
(except for the GTK+2 RE, which should be installed on your system). You don't have
to install it, you just unpack it and type <CODE>./bygfoot</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't work, you have to resort to a package for your distro or the
source package.
</P>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H2>The source package</H2>
<P>
This section is directed at Linux users. If you use Windows and REALLY REALLY want
to try to compile the source package, have a look at
<A HREF="http://bygfoot.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=457">this thread at the forums</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<P>
To be able to compile the source package, you need to have the following development packages
installed (note the word <I>development</I>; it means that on a common system, it doesn't suffice
to have gtk-VERSION installed you need gtk-devel-VERSION or something similar).
</P>
<UL>
<LI>gtk+2
<LI>pango
<LI>atk
<LI>glib2
<LI>pkgconfig
</UL>

<P>
To build, you also need GNU make and a C compiler, of course.
</P>
<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H3>Compiling</H3>
<P>
If the requirements are fulfilled, extract the source package (called <CODE>bygfoot-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2</CODE>)
by calling <CODE>tar xfj bygfoot-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2</CODE>, go to the build directory (called bygfoot-X.Y.Z)
and type <CODE>./configure</CODE>. (To see a list of options that can be passed to the script,
type <CODE>./configure --help</CODE>.)
</P>
<P>
If the script runs fine and creates the Makefiles you can proceed by typing <CODE>make</CODE>
to compile the sources. If the configure script exits with an error, have a look
at the error message and try to figure out what's missing (e.g. GTK+2 version too
old).
</P>
<P>
After you've compiled the sources, you have to become superuser (type <CODE>su -</CODE>
followed by the root password); switch to the build directory and type
<CODE>make install</CODE>. This will copy the compiled executables and the data files
to the appropriate destinations, typically to <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> (executables)
and <CODE>/usr/local/share/bygfoot</CODE> (data files).
</P>
<P>
To uninstall the game, type <CODE>make uninstall</CODE> in the build directory; you have
to be superuser to do this.
</P>
<P>
Because of this uninstall possibility, you should leave the build dir alone even
after you've installed the game successfully (unless you don't mind if your system
gets cluttered with compiled packages).
</P>
<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H2>Updating the source package</H2>
<P>
As of versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.1 an online update script called
<CODE>bygfoot-update</CODE> is shipped with Linux/Unix packages. The script can be used
to accomplish various tasks:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Update the source package. This is meant to be an easy way of keeping
  your <B>Bygfoot</B> package up-to-date without having to check the website
  regularly.
<LI>Get official player and team names. Since I don't have a license for official
  team names, in <B>Bygfoot</B> packages mostly city names are used as team names.
  You can use this feature of the update script to replace the inofficial names
  with the official names.
<LI>Download a package. The script can be used to download a <B>Bygfoot</B> package
  without having to visit the website.
<LI>Get a CVS version. The script can be used to get the current CVS version of <B>Bygfoot</B>
  without having to mess with the <CODE>cvs</CODE> syntax.
</UL>

<P>
Since the script is menu-driven (using <B>zenity</B> if available or <B>dialog</B> if not),
there isn't much to explain about it. You can call <CODE>bygfoot-update --help</CODE> (or <CODE>-h</CODE>)
to see a summary of command line options.
</P>
<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<H2>Getting a CVS version</H2>
<P>
The CVS version is the bleeding-edge <B>Bygfoot</B> version.
You can use it to explore features that are being developed before they get
included in an official release. You can also help iron out bugs before
releases.
</P>
<P>
I've never used CVS with Windows, so I can't help Windows users here.
The rest of this section applies to Unix/Linux users.
</P>
<P>
The easiest way to get a CVS version is to use the update script.
Just call <CODE>bygfoot-update --cvs</CODE>, select a directory where the cvs version
should get downloaded to, choose 'anonymous' as username and press OK.
</P>
<P>
You can also use <CODE>cvs</CODE> directly, but the <CODE>cvs</CODE> syntax isn't simple
and you better read the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=46139">SourceForge.Net instructions</A>
first.
