<B>Bygfoot</B> 1.8.1 is released. This version contains some minor bugfixes
and a country file for Belgium (thanks to ATD). Unfortunately just after releasing
this version I found the job offer bug. If you're really really annoyed by that
one, get a CVS version (easiest with the `bygfoot-update` script) or get a patch
for your src package (ditto).
</P>
<P>
You can download the new packages

A new major stable release is available. <B>Bygfoot</B> 1.8.0 is mostly identical
to the last release of the development branch, <B>Bygfoot</B> 1.7.3.
You can download different packages
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=46139&amp;package_id=109486&amp;release_id=301142">here</A>
or using the `bygfoot-update` script (a Debian package will be provided in a few days).
</P>
<P>
See the <A HREF="changelog.html">ChangeLog</A> to see a more or less complete list
of changes.
</P>
<P>
Being the first release of a new stable branch, this version is bound to
contain a lot of bugs. Please <A HREF="feedback.html">email me</A> or report at the
<A HREF="forum">home page forums</A> if you find any.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to my usual release policy there isn't a simultaneous development
release (1.9.0) because I'm currently rewriting the game from scratch using
a lot of GLib magic and other stuff I've learned while writing 0.5 - 1.8.
So 1.9 will take quite some time. Please be patient, I hope it'll be worth the
waiting.

Browsing the <A HREF="http://www.wesnoth.org">Wesnoth</A> forums, I realized that
the forums for bug reports, feature requests etc. at SourceForge are
quite Spartan and sparse in comparison. So I asked Isaac Clerencia,
who's one of the Wesnoth admins (and does the Debian packages for Bygfoot),
how they manage their forums. It turned out be simple and easy (using
<A HREF="http://www.phpBB.com">phpBB</A>), so:
<A HREF="http://bygfoot.sourceforge.net/forum">do have a look at the new forum system!</A>
</P>
<P>
Please don't post anymore at the forums at the SF.net project site; use these instead.

There's a Wiki for <B>Bygfoot</B> containing some tips for the game. It consists of a few
pages only, but I'm really hoping it will replace the game documentation some day
in the future. You can find
<A HREF="http://mec-symonds.eng.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Bygfoot/WebHome">the Wiki here</A>.
Feel free to contribute if you have any interesting tips and documentation about the game

<B>Bygfoot</B> 1.6.3 and 1.7.3 are available. You can download the stable release
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=46139&amp;package_id=109486&amp;release_id=284911">here</A>

<P>
If you have the source package of an older version containing the `bygfoot-update` script, you can
also use the script to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
The main new features of 1.7.3 are
</P>
<UL>
<LI>save files are zip-compressed XML files (instead of binary),
<LI>there's a history for the development of players and teams.
<LI>added gettext support and some languages

Reviczky Ádám János has made a country file for Hungary. You can
download it from the <A HREF="extras.html">extras section</A> or using the `bygfoot-update` script
(to download the official team names package).
</P>

He's also edited the team TSV 1860 München from Germany; the definition's available from
the <A HREF="extras.html">extras section</A>, too.

<P>
Current development plans are:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Make ''histories'' for players and teams (ie., the development of values like
  skill, wage, goals for players; or rank, money, goal difference for teams, is
  stored in an array). This is already implemented in the CVS version, but histories
  lead to HUGE save files, and we're still trying to find a solution.
<LI>Switch the load/save system to XML. This is implemented, too, but there are
  still problems to solve; e.g., loading an XML file requires a lot of memory,
  which doesn't get freed afterwards, miraculously.
<LI>After the above issues are resolved, release 1.7.3. 1.6.3 might be released earlier.
<LI>After the releases, I'm planning to begin work on a thorough rewriting of the league,
  cup and fixtures system, which should lead to a lot more flexibility. Having exactly
  the systems used in different countries (e.g. different number of teams in the leagues,
  different cup systems, different promotion/relegation systems) shouldn't be a problem
  then. This will lead to the next major unstable release, 1.9.0. Though it'll take quite
  a lot of time, obviously.

There weren't any major changes; some bugs were fixed and I had to remove the official team names

If you've compiled <B>Bygfoot</B> 1.7.1 or 1.6.1 yourself, you can use the
`bygfoot-update` script to upgrade to 1.7.2 or 1.6.1. However, the update script
shipped with 1.7.1 is a bit immature, so here's how you have to do the
update (you shouldn't experience problems if you update 1.6.1):
</P>
<OL>
<LI>First possibility:
 <OL>
 <LI>Call `bygfoot-update` and apply the first patch (revision 2).
 <LI>Quit the update by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
 <LI>Call the update script again and apply the remaining patches.
 <P></P>
 This should make sure that everything's all right.
 <P></P>
 </OL>
<LI>Second possibility:
 <OL>
 <LI>Call `bygfoot-update` and apply all patches.
 <LI>Call `bygfoot-update` again. This will update the update script but of
   course won't install new patches because your package is already up-to-date.
   The old `bygfoot-update` script will be saved to `bygfoot-update.old`; you
   can remove it if you like.
 <LI>There's a GUI frontend for the update script in `support-files` called
   `bygfoot-update-gui`. Unfortunately it's not executable, although it should be.
   So now you do a `chmod 744 support-files/bygfoot-update-gui`.

 Done.

Arturo Mendez has created a country file for Mexico. You can download

team Tigres UANL; you can download the team definition from the

<P>
The online update script, the first version of which was shipped with
<B>Bygfoot</B> 1.6.1 and 1.7.1, has been improved a lot. Those who use the <B>Bygfoot</B>
source package of the mentioned versions can upgrade their package by
calling `bygfoot-update` in the source package directory. The patch
for 1.6.1 updates the update script and the country file for Italy.
</P>
<P>
There are two patches for 1.7.1; please download the second one using
the `bygfoot-update` script that has been updated with the first patch
(in other words: call `bygfoot-update`, apply revision 2, quit `bygfoot-update`;
now call `bygfoot-update` again and apply revision 3).
</P>
<P>
The updates contain the country files for Mexico and Italy, a GUI frontend for
the update script and an improved version of the script.

<LI>The infamous 'game-hangs-at-end-of-season-when-live-game-is-switched-on-and-there-are-no-games'
  bug is corrected; I hope there won't be any serious bugs in the 1.6 branch anymore.
<P></P>
<LI>The source packages contain the first version of the `bygfoot-update` script that

There are new major releases: <B>Bygfoot</B> 1.6.0 (stable version) and 1.7.0
(development version). 1.6.0 is essentially the former development version 1.5.2,
which is hopefully stable enough now; at least there weren't any bug reports.

There's a CVS repository for <B>Bygfoot</B> now, which means the current development 
version (i.e., the version that's being worked on and that will eventuall become
the next official development release) is accessible for anyone now.
</P>
<P>
To see the current ChangeLog (which will tell you about the changes compared 
to the latest official releases) visit

To get a CVS version you need a CVS client (which should be included in your 
linux distro). You type
</P>
<P>
--- cvs -d:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@cvs.sf.net">anonymous@cvs.sf.net</A>:/cvsroot/bygfoot checkout bygfoot-unstable
</P>
<P>
in a console window. This will download a directory called "bygfoot-unstable". 
You can compile and install the downloaded package just like any other src 
package with "./configure &amp;&amp; make" and "make install".
</P>
<P>
The package also contains the glade files needed to modify the <B>Bygfoot</B>
interface (which is generated by <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org">Glade</A>). If you'd 
like to change the source code of <B>Bygfoot</B>, have a look at the README_CVS file.

<B>Bygfoot</B> 1.4.2 and 1.5.1 are available. Having released 1.4.1 and 1.5.0
seems to have been quite a waste of time now <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="images/smileys/sad.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">. But since people were complaining
about the transfer list bug (I've got to admit, it really was an annoying bug)
I didn't want to release only a patch; especially considering that the rpm-version of 1.4.0
was the most successful of the different packages.
</P>
<P>
So, the only difference between the previous releases and these ones is the correction
of the transfer list bug. If you don't experience problems (I suspect the bug doesn't occur
if you let the program sort the list), you don't have to upgrade.

<B>Bygfoot</B> 1.4.1 and 1.5.0 are released. 1.4.0 is merely a bugfix release, prompted by
the bookmaker's tip bug:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>corrected the freeze bug that occurred when you had a
`$HOME/.bygfoot` directory from an older Bygfoot version
<LI>fixed bookmaker's tip bug (thanks to metoneca)
<LI>changed that absurd 'physicist' to 'physio'
<LI>reduced the damage a fire caused to the stadium
</UL>

<P>
1.5.0 contains additionally some new and untested features.

<H3>July 9, 2004</H3>
<P>
We have decided to adapt a convention concerning the version numbering 
introduced and followed by projects that are not as famous as Bygfoot 
but nevertheless nice and well-done, e.g. the Linux kernel.
</P>
<P>
In the future there will be two parallel versions of the program, the 
stable version with version numbers X.Y.Z where Y is an even number, and 
a development version with version numbers X.(Y + 1).Z where Y is the middle 
version number of the current stable version. Releases for the stable branch 
will only contain bugfixes and stability improvements, the development 
version will be the playground for new features; the latter will lead 
after a period of testing to the new stable version with number X.(Y + 2).Z.
</P>
<P>
To sum it up: the next two releases (which will probably appear simultaneously)
will have version numbers 1.4.1 and 1.5.0. There won't be a great 
difference between them (at this point we have to forget my news 
about version numbers that i wrote some days ago); 1.4.1 will 
contain some bugfixes and 1.5.0 will additionally contain one or 
two new features that need some testing.

occurs when you have a `$HOME/.bygfoot` directory created by a version

</P>
<OL>
<LI>The ruthless way: delete `$HOME/.bygfoot`. You can't use your old savegames, 
anyway.
<P></P>
<LI>The not-so-ruthless way: delete only `$HOME/.bygfoot/text_files/teams`. 
This file causes the problem.

<LI>possibility to play in international cups only (e.g. participate
in Champions' League only, without playing regular league games)
<P></P>
<LI>you can see information on your next opponents in the right part

<P></P>
<LI>swapping two players automatically adapts team structure (but
you can switch this off, of course)
<P></P>
<LI>the "Rearrange Team" button automatically changes the team
structure to the appropriate value
<P></P>
<LI>added export/import features to the Editor; you can export
individual teams to files and import such files into your local
team definitions file
<P></P>
<LI>extended the filter rules for transfer list notification
<P></P>
<LI>players are put onto the transfer list by right-clicking instead
of left-clicking; left-clicking always swaps players now
<P></P>
<LI>savegames located in the `$HOME/.bygfoot/saves` directory can be
loaded from the command line without full path names
<P></P>
<LI>introduced playing style for cpu-teams (they always played
balanced until now)
<P></P>
<LI>added variable interest rates for your debts (the more you owe,
the lower the interest rate)
<P></P>
<LI>added possibility to display fixtures of all leagues
</UL>

<P>
NOTE: This version is unfortunately not compatible anymore to
saved games of previous versions.
