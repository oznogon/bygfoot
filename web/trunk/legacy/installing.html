<H2>Installing "Binaries"</H2>
<P>
Linux programs are sometimes distributed in "binary" format (though this is 
not recommended). A "binary" is a compressed file containing a program ready 
to run on any system. However, "binaries" may fail to run if your system's 
configuration is too different from the compiler's.
</P>
<P>
You can recognise the "binaries" because they are named like
`bygfoot-X.Y.Z-bin.tar.bz2` (where X.Y.Z stand for the version numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Some binaries need to be installed (and are usually provided with an "install"
program you are supposed to run as root before using. <B>Bygfoot</B> binaries, 
however, are ran without system-wide installation. Local installation has some 
downsides, but it sure won't tamper with your system.
</P>
<P>
To run <B>Bygfoot</B> binaries you only need to unpack (i.e. "uncompress) the
binary <A HREF="glossary.html#tarball">tarball</A> using this command: `tar xjf bygfoot-X.X.X-bin.tar.bz2`
</P>
<P>
Once you have unpacked <B>Bygfoot</B>, enter the directory just created and run the
executable file in there.
</P>
<H2>Installing "Packages"</H2>
<P>
"Packages" are special files used by Linus distros to distribute the programs they 
supply (or are supplied by third-part "packagers"). The three most-popular package
formats for Linux are the RedHat Package Manager format (RPM), the Debian packages
(DEB) and the Slackware Packages (TGZ, a.k.a. "Slackpacks").
</P>
<P>
Installing from packages is a much better option if your system uses the same
configuration as the packager. It will allow you to update <B>Bygfoot</B> easily when
the next version comes and will prevent left-over files to remain lurking in your
system if you ever choose to uninstall it.
</P>
<P>
= RPM packages:
  To install RPM packages (*.rpm) just type `rpm -Uvh bygfoot-X.Y.Z.arch.rpm`
  at the command-line. Where "arch" is the architecture of the system (i386 
  means Intel-standard motherboards 386 and up). To uninstall you only need to 
  type `rpm -e bygfoot` (notice that to uninstall you only type the package 
  name). There are also some graphical front-ends for the rpm tool, like 
  <A HREF="http://docs.kde.org/3.0/kdeadmin/kpackage">Kpackage</A>, 
  xrpm (seems to be dead), <A HREF="http://www.virtualworlds.de/GRPM">gnorpm</A> and 
  <A HREF="http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic">Synaptic</A>.
</P>
<P>
= DEB packages:
  To install DEB packages (*.deb) just type `dpkg --add bygfoot-X.X.X.arch.deb`
  at the command-line. <B>Bygfoot</B> is now part of the "unstable" branch of the
  Debian system, which means that now you can install it using `apt-get install`
  like any good and respectable official Debian package... You can always use
  graphical front-ends too, like <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gdpm">Gnome-dpkg</A>
  or <A HREF="http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic">Synaptic</A>.
</P>
<P>
= Slackware Packages:
  It seems (no one of us uses Slackware) that packages are installed by the
  `pkgtool` command. You should refer to its manpage to learn more. There are
  front-ends for pkgtool as well, like <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gnome-pkgtool">gnome-pkgtool</A>.
</P>
<H2>Compiling from Sources</H2>
<P>
This is the most-recommended method of installation, especially for those users
who have mastered Linux to some point and for those who wish to install <B>Bygfoot</B>
on other systems.
</P>
<H3>System Requirements</H3>
<P>
To compile <B>Bygfoot</B> from source you must have available the
following resources:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A C compiler (the GNU C Compiler -- gcc is highly recommended).
<P></P>
<LI>The Gimp Tool Kit (a.k.a. GTK+) version 2 (but Gnome is not used).
<P></P>
<LI>Some development packages:
  <UL>
  <LI>pango
  <LI>atk
  <LI>freetype2
  <LI>glib2
  <P></P>
  </UL>
<LI>At least 64 MB RAM so that the game won't seem to run like a turtle...
<P></P>
<LI>A Pentium II class processor at 400 Mhz at least. This requirement is meant
for Intel-based systems, if you are somewhere else I don't even guess how much
processing power you will need.
</UL>

<H3>Supported Platforms</H3>
<P>
Up to now, <B>Bygfoot</B> has been successfully compiled in the following 
systems (in alphabetical order):
</P>
<UL>
<LI>FreeBSD
<LI>Conectiva Linux (9, 8 must work too)
<LI>Debian Testing
<LI>Mandrake Linux (8)
<LI>Red Hat Linux (7.3)
<LI>Suse Linux (9.0, others should work, too)
<LI>Windows (through the Unix/Linux emulator <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</A>,
   a native Win32 port is yet to be tried)
</UL>

<P>
We strongly encourage you to port Bygfoot to your OS and send us the news. We
will link back to you and add your name to our <A HREF="thanks.html">Thank You</A> page.
</P>
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> must be easy to port to any POSIX-compliant system where the above
required resources are available. There is already a port to FreeBSD available 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/games/bygfoot">here</A>.
</P>
<H3>Step by Step Compilation</H3>
<P>
In order to compile <B>Bygfoot</B> you must have all the development libraries. 
In my Conectiva 9 system this means the packages "task-c-devel" and "gtk+2-devel".
If you have all that is necessary to compile the tarball, follow these steps to
easily compiling it (all commands within a terminal window):
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Unpack the compressed file: `tar -xzf file.tar.gz`
<P></P>
<LI>Enter the source directory: `cd bygfoot-X.Y.Z/` (replace X, Y, Z
with the appropriate version numbers)
<P></P>
<LI>Let "configure" test whether you have all that is necessary 
to compile the package and prepare the Makefile: `./configure` (pay
attention to the dot and the slash, they're required to run the 
configure script).
<P></P>
<LI>Compile everything: `make all-recursive`
<P></P>
<LI>If no errors are found, install the package (as root): `make install`
</OL>

<P>
If you didn't understand any of the compilation directives given
above, you are not prepared to compile bygfoot and should refer to one
of the binary packages (bin, rpm or deb).
</P>
<H2>Building Packages</H2>
<P>
The bygfoot-X.Y.Z.src.rpm package is there to allow you to build your own
RPM package. If you have all the required software, you can just type
`rpm --rebuild bygfoot-X.Y.Z.src.rpm` and wait for the (long) process
of building. The compilation won't even start if something is missing and
will stop if there's any incompatibility along the way.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it may happen that you have a required package, but under a 
different name. E.g.: in Mandrake systems you have "gtk2" and "libgtk2-devel",
while in Conectiva systems you have "gtk+2" and "gtk+2-devel". If this
happens, you can circumvent this by editing the ".spec" file used as template
for compilation. By default this file will be found at /usr/src/rpm/SPECS/.
</P>
<H2>Upgrading</H2>
<P>
New versions are expected to appear quite often. So, you must be aware of the
processes needed to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT</B> -- If you are about to upgrade to a version that is not compatible
with saved games or text files from previous versions, remove manually (or rename)
your local configuration directory ($HOME/.bygfoot) before running the game for 
the first time. Otherwise the game may freeze or refuse to start.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to uninstall <B>Bygfoot</B> before upgrading if you
can use RPM "packages" because the default installation command (`rpm -Uvh`)
automagically checks whether an older version is installed and -- if yes -- 
switches to updating. If you usually install programs using the `rpm -i`
command (not recommended) you will get an error message though. Use `rpm -U`
and everything will be OK.
</P>
<P>
On Debian systems upgrading is easy if you have added <B>Bygfoot</B>'s repository
to your `sources.list` configuration. Whenever a new version is uploaded you
will be able to upgrade with the `apt-get upgrade` command. Otherwise you 
will have to use `dpkg`.
</P>
<P>
Slackware users please refer to the manpage of your pkgtool.
</P>
<P>
If you have compiled <B>Bygfoot</B> from Sources, you must remove it before 
installing a new version. You can remove it with the `make uninstall` command,
but you may also have to remove manually the directories where the default 
resources were installed (`$PREFIX/share/bygfoot`).
</P>
<H2>Post-Installation</H2>
<P>
Your <B>Bygfoot</B> installation will only be done after the first time you run
it successfully. During the first run, several files will be copied from the
shared configuration directory (`$PREFIX/share/bygfoot`) to your local 
configuration directory (`$HOME/.bygfoot`). Don't interrupt this process.
If anything goes wrong, remove the local configuration directory so that
<B>Bygfoot</B> "thinks" it is a first run and does the copying again... :-)
</P>
<H2>Online update</H2>
<P>
As of versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.1 there's an online update script called
`bygfoot-update` for the source package, located in the directory with
the configure script. In theory, users using the source package
shouldn't have to download new versions anymore, they can simply use
the update script to keep their version up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
You need an internet connection and the programs `wget` and `patch` to
be able to use the script. If you have these, do the following:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Connect to the internet.
<LI>Call `bygfoot-update`.
<LI>Enter the directory of your source package (default is PWD, so you
  don't have to enter anything if you're already in the directory).
<LI>Enter a temp directory you have read/write access to (default is
  `/tmp`).
</OL>

<P>
Now the script tries to find out your revision number and package type
(stable/unstable) from the file `revision_number` in the package
directory. Then it retrieves a list of available revision patches from
the Bygfoot homepage and asks you whether to apply those which are
new.
</P>
<P>
I hope this will work well. The idea is great (isn't it?) but I don't
have a lot of experience with such things. If you find a bug,
<A HREF="feedback.html">contact me</A>.
