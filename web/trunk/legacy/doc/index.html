<P>
There is no official and full-fledged documentation for <B>Bygfoot</B> 1.9. There are at
least two reasons for this:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Writing documentation is -- justly -- regarded as a loathsome and tedious task
  by most programmers, including me; and since <B>Bygfoot</B> is a hobby project, done
  in my free time, nobody can force me to write documentation <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../images/smileys/wink.png" BORDER="0" ALT="">.
<P></P>
<LI><B>Bygfoot</B> is a very simple game. It's meant to be simple, easy to grasp
  and easy to play. There are VERY few features that aren't obvious to the user
  after playing for half an hour.
</UL>

<P>
Nevertheless there are a few possibilities to get the information you want:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>If you want to install the game, <A HREF="install.html">read the Installation Guide</A>.
<LI><A HREF="../forum">Go to the forums</A> and ask away in the appropriate forum, e.g. in "Help!".
<LI><A HREF="http://mec-symonds.eng.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Bygfoot/WebHome">Go to the Bygfoot Wiki</A>
  and see if you can find anything useful there; you're also encouraged to add to the
  Wiki.
<LI>There are a couple of extensive HOWTOs for the Bygfoot 1.9 definition system
  which <A HREF="1.9/def_howto.html">can help you write your own country or team definition.</A>
<LI>If you just want to quickly look up the meaning/usage of a <B>Bygfoot</B> XML tag,
  have a look at the <A HREF="1.9/tags_ref.html">tags reference</A>.
<LI>If all else fails don't hesitate to <A HREF="../feedback.html">contact us</A>.
</OL>

<P>
There is still some old documentation for the 1.8 branch, some of which
is probably still relevant for the new versions. You might want to browse
these, too:
</P>
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="fulldoc.html">The full documentation for versions &lt; 1.9.0.</A>
<LI><A HREF="faq.html">FAQ</A> for <B>Bygfoot</B> and the <B>Bygfoot</B> Team Editor, versions &lt; 1.9.0.
</OL>
