<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> is a football (a.k.a. <I>soccer</I>) management game for Linux and 
other UNIX look-alikes. It is an original concept by Gyözö Both and has been 
improved with suggestions by players from all over the world.
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and 
selling them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be
promoted or relegated, even become a champion. It includes a "team editor" 
which you can use to create your own teams or edit the existing ones. The 
game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep 
one eye at your players and another at your stadium.
<P>
You can customise <B>Bygfoot</B> by writing your own country definitions file 
or by creating your own team definitions files. A lot of files should be
available from our <A HREF="extras.html">extras</A> section soon. 
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and has 
been compiled successfully in several Linux distros. It is a living project 
and has been very active lately and your help is really welcome. If you
are a C programmer, acquainted with GTK+, and would like to get to know 
<B>Bygfoot</B> from the inside, please <A HREF="feedback.html">contact</A> the
project owner and come in!

<H2>Something About "Football"</H2>
<P>
You're supposed to skip this FAQ if you are not from countries where people
think "football" is a game to be played with the hands. :-)
<P>
<OL>
<LI>What is "Football", why is it called so and why are there so many sports
named this same way?
<P>
Well, "Football" is a sport invented in England in the XIX century which
has become the most popular, the most watched and most played sport ever. 
It is called "football" because it must be played with the feet (duh!).
There are other sports also named alike, all of them splitted from the
original "football" foundation. They appeared because some people thought
that playing with the feet only was too difficult (no trolling, this is
history).
<P>
<LI>Are you sure that the English invented "football"?
<P>
Well, they wrote the rules and played the first championships. One would say
that this is "inventing" a sport. However, they derived inspiration from
many different sources including ball games played in Japan (<I>kemari</I>), 
Greece (<I>podosferiki</I>) and Italy (<I>calcio</I>). They had their own "ball"
games too, by the way: in mediaeval Britain when a viking incursion was 
defeated the populace used to behead the invaders and kick their heads about 
to celebrate. ;-)
<P>
<LI>How is a football team set?
<P>
A football team is composed by "10 field players and a goal-keeper". The
goal-keeper (usually wearing the number 1) is the only one who can touch the
ball with his hands (but only inside a delimited part of the playing field).
Players are usually divided into three sections: defense, midfield and forward.
<P>
<LI>Why is the goalie allowed to touch the ball?
<P>
Because in the beginning the matches ended with tenths of goals scored. Someone
thought that it would be better if the matches ended with a lower number of
goals, so the goalie was allowed to catch the ball.
<P>
<LI>What is a 	"drawn" game?
<P>
It is a game neither of the teams managed to win. When a game ends tied, both
teams are given 1 point only, instead of 3.
<P>
<LI>Why don't they find a way to  "untie" football matches, like they did to
volleyball, tennis, American football, etc.?
<P>
Well, ways to "untie" football matches do exist (penalty kicks, shoot-out,
extra time, golden goal) but people think they suck because they are not from
the game. Usually only Americans complain about tied games and want to find
ways to work this around. Elsewhere in the world people think it's just
natural that sometimes there is no winner or loser.
<P>
<LI>Where is football played?
<P>
Are you from Venus? It is played on planet Earth, almost everywhere where
grass grows and -- amazingly -- also in some places where people must make
grass grow to be able to play it...
<P>
<LI>Which are the nations where football is strong?
<P>
Are you from Jupiter? Besides England, where it was invented, football is popular
everywhere but the US and Canada, India, Australia, New Zealand and some Central
American Countries. The countries whose national teams are most successful are
(roughly in this order): Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy and France.
<P>
<LI>Why is football so popular?
<P>
No one knows for sure but there are some theories:
 <UL>
<P>
 <LI>it is a game that is not affected by social barriers: the required gear is
 inexpensive and the playing field is natural grass, so it can be played both
 by the riches clubs and the poorest localities.
 <LI>it is a game in which intelligence is more important than brute force: good
 footballers are not necessarily the strongest, but the ones with more body
 flexibility and quicker of mind.
 <LI>it is a game in which the final score is not easily predictable: surprises
 do occur (like Greece beating Portugal in the last Euro).
 <LI>it is a game that values talent above anything else: if you are a good player,
 it doesn't matter if you are ugly, illiterate or plain stupid; you will earn
 a lot of money and become famous. Football is known to be one of the paths
 that can lead a poor boy to stardom (read about Pelé, for instance).
 <LI>it is easy to understand: for every goal scored, one point. Goals are scored
 when the ball enters the goal. Foals are when a player hit another player 
 instead of the ball. Fouls inside the main area become penalty kicks. The
 ball must be controlled with any part of the body but the arm. Onlye the goalie
 can touch the ball. When the ball is kicked off the field it reverts to the
 other team. Violent or unfair players are warned (yellow card) and eventually 
 sent out (red card). There's not TV aid, no measuring tape, no 
 computer-generated statistics, no need for an electronic score keeper. The only
 thing about the game that is a bit obscure is the offside rule, but people seem
 to have taken it for granted for decades.
 </UL>
<P>
<LI>What is a football management game?
<P>
It is a game that simulates a football season. You won't actually see matches
going on: you will only take the management decisions that will cause your team
to either become successful or unsuccessful.
