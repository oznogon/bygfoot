<H2>Command Line Options</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You can specify a directory with the pixmaps and the text-files
needed by adding <CODE>-d your_pixmap_dir</CODE> at the command line.
<P>
<CODE>bygfoot -d ~/.pixmaps</CODE>  
<P>
<LI>You can specify a custom country-file by adding <CODE>-f your_country_file</CODE> 
at the command line.
<P>
<CODE>bygfoot -f ~/country_uzb</CODE>
<P>
<LI>You can load a saved game directly by giving Bygfoot its name
on the command line. If it's located in the "$HOME/.bygfoot/saves" dir,
you can omit the path to the file.
<P>
<CODE>bygfoot michal-1</CODE>
<P>
<LI>You can start the <B>Bygfoot</B> Online Update Frontend by calling
<P>
  <CODE>bygfoot -u</CODE> or <CODE>bygfoot --update</CODE>.
<P>
   This will work only for those using the <B>Bygfoot</B> source package
  and a version higher than 1.7.1 rev2. Those who use a source package
  of an older version (but higher than 1.6.1) can use the
  <CODE>bygfoot-update</CODE> bash script located in the package directory.
</UL>
<a name="toc2"></a>
<H2>Managing players</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Right clicking on a player will write extended information about him
into the right window, except when you're in transfer mode. You can
also select the player and click on the <CODE>Player</CODE> button and <CODE>Show info</CODE>
to achieve the same.
<P>
<LI>Young players get gradually better (skill-wise); older players get
worse; the age at which a player reaches his peak ability differs
with each player. Goalies' skill decays more slowly.
<P>
<LI>A player's peak ability is his talent value, which is only
indirectly accessible for you through your scout. You only have your
scout's estimation about a player's talent.
<P>
<LI>Getting better or worse means also an update of the player's value
and sometimes his estimated talent. If a player improves, his wage
increases. If he gets worse, his wage stays the same (nasty, isn't it?).
<P>
<LI>If a young player never plays, his improvement is slower; if he's
injured, his development is retarded (so a player who seldom plays
and always gets injured when he does may never reach his talent
value). Conversely, if an older player gets injured, his "decay"
speeds up a bit.
<P>
<LI>Skill is rather more important than fitness (if you have a 8.0 / 90%
and a 7.5 / 95% player, i'd let the first one play -- at least in
important games), BUT: the worse the fitness value of a player, the
more likely the occurance of an injury.
<P>
<LI>The accuracy of the estimated talent depends on your scout's ability.
<P>
<LI>Goalies only count in the "Best players" statistic if they have
participated in at least half of the league games.
<P>
<LI>Goalies lose their ability more slowly as they pass their peak age
(which is also later).
</UL>
<a name="toc3"></a>
<H2>Managing the stadium</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The safer your stadium is, the more people will come to watch your
matches.
<P>
<LI>The attendance depends not only on the safety but also on the type
of game: in a Nationwide Conference game there won't be more than a
couple of thousand spectators no matter how safe your stadium is;
whereas a UEFA Cup final will guarantee a full stadium.
<P>
<LI>In stadiums with bad safety, fires can break out or riots can happen.
<P>
<LI>Your home games are (except for transfers and prize money) your only
source of money, so keep an eye on your stadium (safety decreases
with time).
</UL>
<a name="toc4"></a>
<H2>Buying, selling and firing players</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When in transfer mode (the Transfer List displayed in the right
  window), you can put players from your team on the list by
  right-clicking on them in the left window and remove them by
  right- or left- or middle- or whatever-clicking on them in
  the right window. You can also use the <CODE>Player</CODE> button to do
  these things.
<P>
<LI>You can temporarily sort the transfer list by clicking on one of the column
  headers, e.g. <CODE>Skill</CODE>. If you go back to main menu, the sorting is
  undone. You can sort the list permanently by switching it on in the
  options menu (see <A HREF="advanced.html#toc1">Preferences</A>).
<P>
<LI>You can have <B>Bygfoot</B> warn you with a popup window whenever an
  interesting player appears on the transfer list by specifying some
  conditions in the options menu (see <A HREF="advanced.html#toc1">Preferences</A>).
<P>
<LI>When in transfer mode, there's a small, inconspicuous button (the
  <CODE>Browse teams</CODE> button) with a search symbol on it in the lower right
  corner of the main window. Clicking on it will show a list of all
  teams in the game except your own team. If you click on a team name,
  the player list of the team is displayed (the attributes shown
  depend on the quality of your scout). Now you can try to buy a
  player by clicking on the row he's in. In most cases the team owner
  will refuse to sell the player because there's no adequate
  replacement. But if you're lucky, they have a replacement and you
  receive an offer. But don't be surprised: you'll have to pay a lot
  more for the player than for players on the transfer list; and the
  player will demand a very high wage.
<P>
<LI><B>(Versions &gt;= 1.7.0)</B> Instead of using the <CODE>Browse teams</CODE> button,
  you can also click on a team name in the tables or click on a
  fixture in the fixtures display (in the latter case, left and right
  clicking will show you the home and away team, respectively) to see
  the player list of the team.

<H2>Scout and physio</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The scout is the most important factor when buying or selling
  players. A better scout will:
 <UL>
<P>
 <LI>have more information about players in other teams (such as status
   or age)
<P>
 <LI>be more precise when estimating the player's talent, value and
   wage
<P>
 <LI>find a buyer for your player faster
<P>
 <LI>get more money for the player you sell
 </UL>
</UL>
On the other hand, the better your scout, the higher his wage (which you
pay every week).
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The physio is important when your players are injured.
  A better physio will heal the players faster, but his wage
  depends on his quality. If no player is injured, you don't
  have to pay your physio.
</UL>
<a name="toc6"></a>
<H2>Managing your team's finances</H2>
<P>
Money usually comes in by three ways:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Ticket sales. They only bring you money when you play at 
home (this means: take good care of your stadium and extend it as you can). 
<LI>Player sales. This one is seldom used (you won't want to disband your 
team, do you?). 
<LI>Prizes. If you finish a season as first, second or third, you get some 
prize money. You also get some money for being the winner of the promotion 
games or 4th in league 1, and if one of your players finishes in the top 3
of the goalies or goal scorers statistics, or if he's voted best player.
</OL>
If you desperately need money (e.g. to buy an outstanding player
from the transferlist), you can get a loan from the bank. The amount
of money you can be granted at most depends on the value of your
players and your stadium. You'll have to pay back your loan within
15 weeks, but if you pay it back partly before that, the time limit
might be extended. There's a variable interest rate per week which
depends on the amount you owe (7,5% at most). If you fail to pay 
back your loan in time, you'll get fired.
<P>
There's also a "drawing credit" feature, which allows you to draw more
money from you bank account than your current position. Your drawing credit
depends -- just like the maximum loan -- on your stadium and your players.
<P>

<H2>Starting Bygfoot more comfortably</H2>
<P>
This tip is intended for those who are using the binary package of
<B>Bygfoot</B>:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>copy the directory <CODE>support_files</CODE> to your home directory and rename
  it to <CODE>.bygfoot</CODE>.
<LI>copy the executable to a dir in your PATH (e.g. the directory you store
  the bash scripts you've written).
</OL>
Now you should be able to start <B>Bygfoot</B> from any directory.
<P>
<a name="toc8"></a>
<H2>Parts of a "Season"</H2>
<P>
<B>NOTE</B> -- Cup and League names in this section refer to the English
country file (which is also the template country file... ;-)
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You can browse the fixtures by clicking on "Figures -&gt; Fixtures". Of
  course you won't see all fixtures, but only of those leagues you
  participate in and only of those rounds (in the cups) which have
  been played or for which lots have already been drawn.
<P>
<LI>Each season there are:
  <OL>
<P>
  <LI>League games (5 national leagues),
  <LI>FA Cup games (featuring all English teams, though some teams from
    the first two leagues have a wildcard for the first round),
  <LI>League Cup games (Nationwide Conference teams aren't participating
    here)
  <LI>International Cups:
    <OL>
    <LI>Champions' League games (you'll participate if you win the
    Premiership),
    <LI>Cup Winner's Cup games (you'll participate if you win the
    FA Cup and don't win the Premiership) and
    <LI>UEFA Cup games (you'll participate if you finish 2nd to 4th in
    Premier Division and don't  win the FA Cup)
    </OL>
  <LI>Additionally there's the 
    <OL>
    <LI>Charity Shield between the Premiership champion (or runner-up if
    there's a double winner) and the FA Cup winner and the
    <LI>UEFA Supercup between the CL winner and the UEFA Cup winner.
    </OL>
  <LI>In leagues 2 to 5, the teams ranked 4th to 7th play promotion games
    (a pair of home/away and a final on neutral ground). The winner gets promoted
    along with the first 3 teams in the table.
  </OL>
