<H2>Preferences</H2>
<P>
The "Preferences" window that pops-up when you select "File &gt; Preferences" or
click the "Preferences" tool bar button or press <CODE>O</CODE> (for <CODE>Options</CODE>)
allows you to change the behaviour and appearance of the game. All options
have tooltips, so this documentation section isn't very extensive.
From top to bottom, these are the available options:
<P>
<a name="toc2"></a>
<H3>Confirmations</H3>
<P>
Whether <B>Bygfoot</B> should ask for confirmation every time you tell it to start a new week,
start a new week with injured or banned players in your team or quit without
having saved.
<P>
<a name="toc3"></a>
<H3>Look &amp; Feel</H3>
<P>
Here you can switch live games on and off, configure the message bar and the font the game
uses, change the name of your team and a lot more.
<P>
<a name="toc4"></a>
<H3>Player Attributes</H3>
<P>
What information to show about your players. You can uncheck any of those that
are shown by default or check others that are not. Extra information tabs 
not displayed by default are "yellow cards", "wage" and "value".
<P>
<a name="toc5"></a>
<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>
<P>
Options concering the general behaviour of the game. Among others, you can specify
here whether <B>Bygfoot</B> should warn you when an interesting player appears on
the transfer list and whether you'd like the transfer list to be sorted.
<P>
<a name="toc6"></a>
<H3>Saving your settings to a configuration file</H3>
<P>
If you click on "OK", your settings will be saved for your current
game. If you'd like to save them for future games, too, you can check
the "Save to file" box on the left of the "OK" button. Clicking on "OK"
will save your settings to <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot/text_files/bygfoot.conf</CODE>, and
each time you start <B>Bygfoot</B>, they get loaded automatically.
<P>
<a name="toc7"></a>
<H2>Keeping your job</H2>
<P>
There is one reason for other teams to try and hire you: your team's
success. So if you're first in a league for 20 consecutive weeks
don't be surprised if they try to contract you. If it gets on your
nerves, you can switch it off in the options window or via the quick
options menu.
<P>
If you get promoted, you'll count as quite successful. If you get relegated 
(or your team's last for 20 consecutive weeks or so), you'll count as 
rather unsuccessful and your team owners might consider firing you.
<P>
There are two additional reasons why you could get fired. First, if
you fail to pay back a loan. Second, if you're financial management
is bad and you're bank account gets below your drawing credit three
times in a season. Each time you'll get some weeks to get positive,
but each time the limit will be shorter.
<P>
If you finish in a league among the last 4 teams, you get relegated
(except, of course, the last division).
<P>
If you finish in a league among the first three, you get promoted
(except, of course, the first Division).
<P>
If you finish in a league (except the Premier Division) from 4th to
7th, you will play promotion games: one round of home/away games, and
if you win, a game on neutral ground against the other winner. If you win this
one, you're promoted.
<P>
<a name="toc8"></a>
<H2>Playing a Season</H2>
<P>
Parts of a season's fixtures are generated while playing (e.g. FA
Cup from round 2 upwards) because they depend on previous results.
<P>
You can see how your team fared against your league opponents (i.e.,
the results of the two league games against team XYZ) if you click
on the (quite colorful) <CODE>Show league results</CODE> button that appears
below the right panel when you click on <CODE>Fixtures</CODE>.
<P>
At the end of each season a history page will be written. It
contains your result at the end of the season (rank, team and
league), champions and cup winners and the best players.
<P>
Also at the end of a season there's prize money for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the teams ranked 1st to 3rd and the promotion games winner (or
  the team ranked 4th in league 1),
<P>
<LI><B>(versions &gt;= 1.7.0)</B> the best 3 goalies and goal scorers,
<P>
<LI><B>(versions &gt;= 1.7.0)</B> the best offensive and defensive teams,
<P>
<LI><B>(versions &gt;= 1.7.0)</B> the best player (overall),
<P>
<LI><B>(versions &gt;= 1.7.0)</B> the best defender, midfielder and forward
  (voted by the managers).
</UL>
<a name="toc9"></a>
<H2>Player fitness and injuries</H2>
<P>
One of the most frequently asked questions about <B>Bygfoot</B> is, How does
the fitness value influence the probability of a player getting injured? 
(see <A HREF="manager-faq.html">FAQ</A>) The answer is short and simple: the probability
is inversely proportional to the fitness value. If your player has only
fitness 50%, the probability is twice as high as the probability with
fitness 99%. This sounds very dangerous, but in fact the normal probability
(i.e. with maximum fitness) is only 1,5% for a field player and 0,75% for
a goalie. So a 50%-player is still unlikely (3% probability) to get injured.
