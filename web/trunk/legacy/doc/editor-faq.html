<P>
<OL>
<LI>I'd like to edit a team from a Spanish league but I only see English
teams to choose from.
<P>
You have to select a different country file, in this case 'country_es'.
<P>
<LI>Why is the background of three substitute players grey?
<P>
The human player always starts with 17 players; mainly, because this 
way he has room for transfered players from the beginning. So each time 
you start a new game and your team is loaded from the definitions file, 
players with numbers 13, 16 and 19 are omitted. Practically this means: 
don't put important players on the positions with grey background.
<P>
<LI>I have edited a team and would like to play with it. But each time I
start the game and choose the edited team, some players don't appear in
the player list.
<P>
See previous question.
<P>
<LI>Why should I edit those grey-backgrounded players if they don't get
loaded anyway?
<P>
CPU-teams have 20 players, so if you choose a different
team from the one you edited, the CPU-team that goes with the edited
team will contain all 20 players, even the grey-backgrounded ones.
<P>
<LI>No matter which team I choose, they always contain 20 "nobodies".
<P>
I have specified only a few teams in the default definitions file until
now Real Madrid (Spain), Bayern München, Werder Bremen, Borussia Dortmund
(Germany) and Arsenal (England). So all other teams are blank (as yet). I
hope that a lot of people add their favourite teams to the definitions
file and send it to me, so that I can extend the default file somewhat
in subsequent versions.
<P>
<LI>I'd like player number X to be a goalie, but he's always a defender.
<P>
The position of a player is determined by the two structure values above
the right upper corner of the player list. If the first is 442, it means
that players with numbers 2 to 5 are defenders, 6 to 9 midfielders and
10 and 11 forwards. Players 1 and 12 are always goalies. The positions
of the rest of the substitutes, players 13 to 20 are determined by the
second structure value, e.g. 332. If you'd like to change the position
of a player, you either have to change the structure accordingly or swap
the player with another one.
<P>
<LI>Can I enter special characters like Ü or Ô and the like?
<P>
Definitely. They should even get displayed correctly in the game. 
Special characters are the reason why I switched to UTF-8 encoding.
<P>
<LI>Can I delete a player completely?
<P>
You can't in the sense that you don't see him in the list afterwards, but 
if you specify a name with a "#" as first character, the player won't be 
loaded at startup.
<P>
<LI>I've got a player who'll turn 30 in two months. In the list, however,
he's 30 already!
<P>
The ages are stored as floating-point numbers, and in the list they're 
rounded to integer numbers. So a player between 29 years and 6 months and 
30 years and 5 month is shown as a 30-year-old.
<P>
<LI>What does this "Average skill" part of the window mean?
It shows the average skill of the team you currently edit. Its purpose is 
mainly to help you create a team that's not very out-of-place compared to 
the other teams in the game. In your first season, teams in League 1 have
average skills of around 8.0; very good teams perhaps 8.7 or 8.8, bad
teams 7.0 or 7.2.  UEFA-Cup teams are on average as good as League 1
teams, CWC and CL teams about 0.2 and 0.4 better, respectively.
<P>
<LI>I appreciate the whole definitions stuff, but in my opinion it makes the
game more predictable and unbalanced. Can't I turn it off?
<P>
Of course. Simply check the "Don't load team definitions" checkbutton in 
the team selection window and loading definitions is switched off completely.
If you'd still like to have the names of the players, but random skill
values etc., check the 'Load only names' checkbutton. If you'd like
to load your team only, check the "Load my team" and "Don't load team
definitions" buttons.
<P>
<LI>I've edited a team. Where can I find the definitions file the editor
stored it in?
<P>
The first time you start the Bygfoot Team Editor, it
tries to create a directory called <CODE>.bygfoot</CODE> in your home directory and
the subdirectories <CODE>text_files</CODE> and <CODE>saves</CODE>. It then tries to copy the
customizable text files to the former subdirectory (the <CODE>saves</CODE> subdir
is meant for your savegames). Your edited teams should be in the file
<CODE>~/.bygfoot/text_files/teams</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>I have edited a team which isn't in one of the five leagues, but takes
part in a European cup. The names get loaded correctly, but when I look
at the team in transfer browse mode, the skill and talent and age values
are all wrong!
<P>
For international cup teams only the names get loaded.
This is because they have to have a certain average skill level (otherwise
it'd be too easy or too hard to win a cup), and I don't want to have
this level all messed up.
<P>
<LI>I have written definitions of 2.450.320 teams from different
countries. Would you like to have them?
 YES! Send them to Gyözö Both
&lt;gyboth_at_bygfoot_dot_com&gt; so that I can include them in the default
definitions file of the next <B>Bygfoot</B> version. But try to be truthful,
don't put only 9.9 players into your favourite team.
