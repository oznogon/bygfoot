<H2>Running Bygfoot</H2>
<P>
There are two possible ways to run <B>Bygfoot</B>.
<P>
If you have installed it system-wide, the executable will be in the $PATH
environment so you only need to type <CODE>bygfoot</CODE> at a command line to run it.
<P>
If you are using locally the compiled binary you will need to use a terminal
window to enter the directory where the executable is and type <CODE>./bygfoot</CODE>.
<P>
<B>TIP</B>: Add an alias `alias bygfoot='path_to_the_executable/bygfoot -d
path_to_the_support_dir'<CODE> to your </CODE>$HOME/.alias` file and you'll be able to 
run <B>Bygfoot</B> from anywhere. Example: `alias 
bygfoot='/home/john/games/bygfoot/bygfoot -d 
/home/john/games/bygfoot/support_files'`.
<P>
<a name="toc2"></a>
<H2>The Start-Up Window</H2>
<P>
Upon starting, <B>Bygfoot</B> will show you a window containing the following
sections (downwards):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Team Selection
<LI>League Selection
<LI>Country Selection
<LI>Team Options
<LI>File Options
</UL>
<a name="toc3"></a>
<H3>Team Selection</H3>
<P>
This is a list of 114 teams you can choose from. By default, this list contains
English teams (because England is <B>Bygfoot</B>'s default country). To select a
team you can either click or scroll down with the arrow keys. You can also use
the scrollbar to navigate through the list.
<P>
<a name="toc4"></a>
<H3>League Selection</H3>
<P>
The second row asks you which League you want to play in. By default the
"Current League" option will be selected. This means that if you choose a 
team from 5th division it will play 5th but if you choose a team 
from Premier League it will play Premier League.
<P>
The other options are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Top League</B>: You will start in 1st league, regardless of the team you
choose.
<LI><B>Bottom League (the hard way)</B>: You will start in 5th league, even if you
choose a 1st league team.
<LI><B>CL</B>: Champions' League only.
<LI><B>CWC/Conm.</B>: You will only play the Cup Winners' Cup.
<LI><B>UEFA/Sul-Americana</B>: You will only play the UEFA Cup.
</UL>
<a name="toc5"></a>
<H3>Country Selection</H3>
<P>
The third row allows you to select which country to play with. The current
<B>Bygfoot</B> version is shipped with 8 country files: England (default), Germany,
Italy, France, Spain, Romania, Brazil and Poland.
<P>
If none of them pleases you (or if you wish to play a different one) you can
select a custom country file by clicking the "Select a country file" button.
<P>
<a name="toc6"></a>
<H3>Team Options</H3>
<P>
Here are some options affecting the team definitions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Don't load team definitions</B> will cause <B>Bygfoot</B> to generate all 
teams from scratch. All teams will be composed by randomly generated players.
<LI><B>Load only names from team definition file</B> will cause <B>Bygfoot</B> to
attribute random skills to players. 
<LI><B>Load my team from definitions file</B> will cause only your team to be read
from definitions. The others will be full of "nobodies".
</UL>
The button labelled "Start Bygfoot Team Editor" will start <B>Bygfoot</B> in
editing mode, allowing you to create or modify teams.
<P>
<a name="toc7"></a>
<H3>File Options</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You can start playing with the selected (or pre-selected) options by clicking
"OK".
<LI>You can leave <B>Bygfoot</B> by clicking "Cancel".
<LI>Or you can load a saved game by clicking "Load game".
</UL>
<a name="toc8"></a>
<H2>Game Interface</H2>
<P>
After the Start-Up Window, <B>Bygfoot</B> will generate the game and the playing
window will appear, containing the following elements:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Menu Bar
<LI>Toolbar
<LI>Status Bar (directly below the toolbar)
<LI>Message Bar (between the panels and the status bar)
<LI>Left Panel
<LI>Right Panel
<LI>Management Bar
</UL>
<a name="toc9"></a>
<H3>Menu Bar</H3>
<P>
Contains only two menus:

<LI><B>File</B>
  <UL>
  <LI>New

</DL>
<a name="toc11"></a>
<H3>Status Bar</H3>

</UL>
<a name="toc12"></a>

<P>
This is used sometimes when the program wants to tell you something,
e.g. "You can't do this or that".
<P>
<a name="toc13"></a>
<H3>Left Panel</H3>
<P>
The left panel shows a lot of information about your players:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Name</I>
<LI><I>Current skill</I>. This is computed from the Skill value and the Fitness
  value. The position of a player also plays an important role. Example:
  a forward plays a lot better on a

<P>
<a name="toc15"></a>
<H3>Management Bar</H3>
<P>
The lower tool bar contains icons that allow you to effectively manage 
your team:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Playing Style</I>. Currently <B>Bygfoot</B> supports five playing styles: 
"All Out Defend", "Defend", "Balanced", "Attack" and "All Out Attack".

four skill levels for scouts: "Bad", "Average", "Good" and "Best".
<LI><I>Physio</I>. The quality of your physio.
</UL>
If you have chosen the Transfer List view, a small  icon with a looking-glass
will appear at the right side: it allows you to browse teams to find the 
players you wish to buy. <B>WARNING</B>: Players bought this way are much more
expensive and demand much higher wages.
<P>
If you have chosen the Finances/Stadium view, some other icons will appear:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Capacity (CAP)</I>. Allows you to increase your stadium capacity by
  500 - 2000 seats (depending on how much you'd like to spend and how
  soon you want the seats to be available).
<LI><I>Safety (SAF)</I>. Allows you increase the security level in your stadium.
<LI><I>Loan Money</I>.
<LI><I>Pay Loan</I>.
</UL>
If you have chosen the Week Summary, Fixtures or Tables view, these icons 
will be available:

<UL>
<LI><I>Fixtures</I>. Shows you the full list of matches that have been played 
last week. You can browse fixtures too, checking past and future weeks.
<LI><I>Tables</I>. Shows you the current table of classification. You can 
browse tables, checking other leagues as well.
<LI><I>Fixtures by League</I>. You can browse the fixtures of other leagues as 
well.

</UL>
Most views also add "next" and "previous" arrows so that you can 
navigate around.
<P>
<a name="toc16"></a>
<H2>Keyboard Shortcuts</H2>
<P>
These are always shown as tooltips, too.
<P>
Generally, when an "OK" button can be clicked, "Return" will do just
that; when a "Cancel" or "Close" button can be clicked or a popup window
can be closed, "Escape" will do it.

<H2>Saving and Loading Files</H2>
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> uses the following types of files to store information it will use:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Country File</I> -- <CODE>country_XYZ</CODE> -- where team and league names are stored. This is a UTF-8
plain text file.
<LI><I>Player Names</I> -- <CODE>player_names</CODE> -- where the names that will be randomly attributed to
"nobodies" are stored.
<LI><I>Teams</I> -- <CODE>teams</CODE> -- where team definitions are stored.
<LI><I>Savegames</I> -- encoded files in which information about a game you're
  currently playing is stored.
</OL>
A country file must be written using a UTF-8 enabled text editor like 
<A HREF="http://www.yudit.org">yudit</A> and must follow some rules so that it won't crash
<B>Bygfoot</B>. We'll learn more about them later.
<P>
You can edit the <CODE>player_names</CODE> file and add or remove any names you wish 
to appear in the game. But please keep it big so that players with repeated
names don't appear quite often. This file is always loaded by <B>Bygfoot</B> 
during startup.
<P>
The <CODE>teams</CODE> file stores the team definitions you have written or imported. 
It is also automatically loaded during startup (unless you forbid 
<B>Bygfoot</B> from doing so), but it contains definitions of only a couple 
of teams yet.
<P>
Savegames are stored under <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot/saves</CODE> and can be loaded in 
4 ways: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>As a short command-line switch: <CODE>bygfoot savegame</CODE> where "savegame" is 
the name of a file located in <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot/saves</CODE>.
<LI>As a long command-line switch: <CODE>bygfoot [full path]/savegame</CODE> where "full
path" is the full address of the file "savegame" in your system. This 
option is mandatory if your savegames are saved in another directory but
<CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot/saves</CODE> (why would you do that?).
<LI>From the startup window by selecting "Load Game"
<LI>From the game interface by selecting "Load Game".
</UL>
<a name="toc21"></a>
<H2>The Game Behaviour (Basic)</H2>
<P>
At startup <B>Bygfoot</B> will read team definitions and generate all teams 
that are not defined. After the process is complete (may take some time on 
slow systems) you will see the game interface. If you want to continue a
previously saved game, you can let <B>Bygfoot</B> skip the team generation
by calling it with the savegame file as an argument: <CODE>bygfoot my_save_game</CODE>. 
See also <A HREF="intermediate.html#toc1">command line options</A>.
<P>
To play, you must make some choices:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Select the players you want to be playing by clicking on their names with 
the left mouse button. If you click on a player name and then on another,
they'll swap positions.
<LI>Select the desired team structure and playing strategy.
<LI>Click on the "Begin a new week" button. <B>Bygfoot</B> will hang for a 
short while an then the "Live Game" window will pop up. 
<LI>After the game "ends", click the "Close" button to go back to the 
main window.
</UL>
<B>TIP 1</B> - Don't let your players get too tired or they can be injured more
easily. If a player goes below 90% of his fitness, let him rest for a week by
putting another one in his place.
<P>
<B>TIP 2</B> - Pay attention to the size and the security of your stadium. The
stadium is your main source of money.
