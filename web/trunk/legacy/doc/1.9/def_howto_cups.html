<H2>How to create a cup definition file</H2>
<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H3>General info</H3>
<P>
This is a bit harder than league definitions. Let's look first at
the general stuff, some of which we've already seen. The example
is from the file <CODE>cup_europe_uefa.xml</CODE>.
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;cup&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;short_name&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/short_name&gt;
   &lt;symbol&gt;flag_eu.png&lt;/symbol&gt;
   &lt;sid&gt;europe_uefa&lt;/sid&gt;
  
    # Name, short name, symbol and string id we
    # already know.
  
    &lt;group&gt;1&lt;/group&gt;
  
    # This means the cup belongs to a group of cups
    # that are related in the sense that they may not
    # feature the same teams. All those cups should have
    # the same group number. Currently, the UEFA Cup
    # the Champions' League and the Cup Winners' Cup are
    # all in the same group.
  
    # By default (e.g. if you leave out the tag)
    # this value is -1, which means there is
    # no restriction whatsoever.
  
    &lt;yellow_red&gt;3&lt;/yellow_red&gt;
  
    # We've mentioned this in the leagues: the
    # number of yellow cards a player may accumulate
    # before he gets banned automatically for a
    # match.
  
    &lt;talent_diff&gt;250&lt;/talent_diff&gt;
  
    # This is a bit different from the
    # 'average_talent' tag in league
    # definitions. This one gives the difference of
    # the average talent (in percentage) in the cup
    # compared to the first league in the
    # country. It can also be negative, of
    # course. In this case the cup teams are on
    # average 2,5% better than the teams in the
    # first league.  This is only needed for
    # international cups.
  
    &lt;last_week&gt;44&lt;/last_week&gt;
  
    # It's nicer to be able to give the week of the
    # final, so we don't have a 'first_week' tag for
    # cups, but a 'last_week'.
  
    &lt;week_gap&gt;4&lt;/week_gap&gt;
  
    # The week_gap tag is the same as in league
    # definitions.
  
    &lt;add_week&gt;0&lt;/add_week&gt;
    
    # This determines when the cup fixtures get written
    # and the cup gets added to the cups array. The user
    # doesn't see the cup before this (in the fixtures
    # view, for instance).
  
    # There are four possibilities here:
  
    # 1. Specify 0 (which is also the default
    # value, so we could as well leave out the
    # tag here). The cup gets loaded at the beginning
    # of a season after the promotions/relegations
    # have taken place.
  
    # 2. Specify -1. The cup gets loaded at
    # the beginning of the season before
    # promotions/relegations take place.
  
    # 3. Specify 1000, which means the cup fixtures
    # get generated and the cup becomes visible to
    # the user as soon as the leagues and cups
    # in the cup's choose_teams (see below) are finished.
    # This is used for cups that depend on some leagues'
    # (and/or cups') outcome, e.g. supercups or promotion
    # game cups.
  
    # 4. Specify a normal week number, like 20. In this
    # case the cup fixtures get generated exactly at the end
    # of week 20.
  
    &lt;property&gt;international&lt;/property&gt;
  
    # A cup property. See the tags reference for more properties.
  
    &lt;property&gt;highlight1&lt;/property&gt;
  
    # Another property. This is important for the table
    # colouring of leagues. See the tags reference.
  
  ...snip...
  
  &lt;/cup&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
Another property that can be useful is <CODE>weak_at_home</CODE>. If set,
teams from lower leagues will always play at home against
teams from better leagues in cup rounds with only one match.
</P>
<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H3>Cup stages: cup_rounds</H3>
<P>
How do we know what kind of stages there are in the cup? For this
we have the <CODE>cup_round</CODE> elements. A cup round describes a stage
in the cup, e.g. a stage of round robin games, or a stage of
home-away games (for instance the Champions' League
quarter-finals).
</P>
<P>
Note that you have to write the appropriate number of cup rounds
into the definition. If you have only 8 teams, you can't have 5
rounds of knock-out, you can have only 3. If you have 10 teams,
you'll have 4 rounds (and 6 teams get a bye for the first round).
</P>
<P>
Now, the corresponding part of <CODE>cup_europe_uefa.xml</CODE> looks a bit
weird:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;cup_rounds&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
    &lt;/cup_rounds&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Obviously we have a tag telling us that we have a cup_round
listing here (<CODE>cup_rounds</CODE>) and 5 cup rounds. But why are they
empty? Well, this is simply because when reading definition
files, Bygfoot fills in the attributes that are not explicitly
specified in the file with default values. And for the UEFA Cup
the default values are perfectly fitting.  So let's have a look
at the cup rounds of the <CODE>cup_europe_champ_league.xml</CODE> file:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;cup_rounds&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;number_of_groups&gt;4&lt;/number_of_groups&gt;
  
      # Aha. Here's something. 'number_of_groups',
      # being non-zero, tells us that we have a
      # round robin stage.  We have 4 groups. Of
      # course this means that the number of teams
      # for this cup round HAS TO BE DIVISIBLE BY 4!
      # We'll see how to achieve this later.
  						
      &lt;number_of_advance&gt;2&lt;/number_of_advance&gt;
  
      # This one tells us, how many teams advance
      # from each group.  Here, the first two teams
      # advance.  A tag not used here is
      # 'number_of_best_advance' which would cause a
      # certain number of teams to advance even if
      # they are not among the first in the group if
      # they are among the best of the rest of the
      # teams across all groups.
  
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      # Quarter-final and semi-final are default,
      # home-away pairings.
  
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
       &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
       &lt;neutral&gt;1&lt;/neutral&gt;
     &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      # But the final is is not home-away: it's one
      # match on neutral ground.
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
One final example from the <CODE>cup_england_fa.xml</CODE>
file:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;cup&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;FA Cup&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;short_name&gt;FA Cup&lt;/short_name&gt;
    &lt;symbol&gt;flag_en.png&lt;/symbol&gt;
    &lt;sid&gt;england_fa&lt;/sid&gt;
    &lt;last_week&gt;47&lt;/last_week&gt;
    &lt;week_gap&gt;4&lt;/week_gap&gt;
    &lt;property&gt;national&lt;/property&gt;
  
    # Here we have a national cup.
  
    &lt;cup_rounds&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
  
        # This is something new. If we don't have
        # home-away matches, but only one match, we
        # can specify a 'replay' number. This means,
        # if the first match ends in a draw, the
        # match gets repeated at the away team's
        # place. The replay number can also be
        # greater than 1, which would lead to a
        # third match and so forth if there are
        # draws.
  
        # Replay should only be used when there are
        # no home-away matches, obviously.
  
        &lt;byes&gt;10&lt;/byes&gt;
  
        # We didn't see this tag yet, either.
        # Here we specify how many teams get a bye.
        # If we leave it out, the program computes
        # how many teams have to get a bye so that
        # in the following cup round the number of
        # teams is a power of 2.
  
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
        &lt;byes&gt;0&lt;/byes&gt;
        
        # byes = 0 has to be specified in order to
        # suppress the default game behaviour to
        # give byes so that in the following round
        # there are 2^n teams.
  
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;neutral&gt;1&lt;/neutral&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
        &lt;neutral&gt;1&lt;/neutral&gt;
        &lt;replay&gt;1&lt;/replay&gt;
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
    &lt;/cup_rounds&gt;
  
      # The semi-final and final matches of the FA
      # Cup are on neutral ground (but still with
      # replay, so no extra time and penalty
      # shoot-out in the first match).
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
The complete list of tags available for cup rounds:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>home_away
<LI>replay
<LI>neutral
<LI>byes
<LI>round_robin_number_of_groups
<LI>round_robin_number_of_advance
<LI>round_robin_number_of_best_advance
<LI>delay
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>replay</CODE> should only be used for knock-out cup rounds without home-away
matches.
<CODE>delay</CODE> can be used to delay a cup round by a certain number of
weeks or make it occur earlier (if the value is negative). Take care you don't
get an overlap with the previous round if you use a negative delay.
</P>
<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H3>Participating teams: choose_teams</H3>
<P>
It remains to specify which teams take part in the cup. For this
task there is the <CODE>choose_team</CODE> tag and the CupChooseTeam struct
in the source code.  Let's see how this is done in the
<CODE>cup_england_league.xml</CODE> file:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;choose_teams&gt;
  
    # Tag enclosing the choose_team elements.
  
      &lt;choose_team&gt;
        &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
        &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
      # An element. The league the teams get loaded
      # from is given with its string id.
  
      # Since nothing else is specified here, all
      # teams from that league get loaded.
  
      &lt;choose_team&gt;
        &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england2&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
        &lt;/choose_team&gt;
         &lt;choose_team&gt;
        &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england3&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
        &lt;/choose_team&gt;
         &lt;choose_team&gt;
        &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england4&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
        &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
      # Apparently, all teams from the first four English
      # leagues take part.  Since the number of
      # teams isn't a power of 2, in general, a
      # couple of teams will have a bye for the
      # first cup round (teams from the first leagues
      # are preferred).
  
    &lt;/choose_teams&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Things are a bit more complicated for international cups. The
choose_teams part of <CODE>cup_europe_champ_league.xml</CODE> looks like this:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;choose_teams&gt;
    
    &lt;choose_team&gt;
    &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;LEAGUE1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  
    # ATTENTION: this isn't a normal string id like
    # 'england1'. Here we have ids like 'LEAGUE1',
    # 'LEAGUE2' or 'CUP1', which refer to the
    # leagues and cup arrays of the
    # country. 'LEAGUE1' tells the program to fetch
    # the first team (in the tables) of the first
    # league in the leagues array. In this case we
    # would get (at the end of the season) the
    # Premiership champion.
  
    &lt;number_of_teams&gt;1&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  
    # How many teams do we choose? One.
  
    &lt;start_idx&gt;1&lt;/start_idx&gt;
    &lt;end_idx&gt;1&lt;/end_idx&gt;
  
    # The first one.
  
    &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
  
    # Here come the normal choose_team elements.
    
    &lt;choose_team&gt;
    &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;france1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  
    # Now this is a normal string id again, telling
    # us to get the teams from the
    # 'league_france1.xml' file.
  
    &lt;number_of_teams&gt;1&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  
    # One team only.
  
    &lt;randomly&gt;1&lt;/randomly&gt;
  
    # Randomly chosen. Since we don't specify a
    # range with 'start_idx' and 'end_idx', the team
    # gets chosen from all teams in the league.
  
    &lt;generate&gt;1&lt;/generate&gt;
  
    # This tells the program to load the team name
    # from an xml file and generate it instead of looking
    # for it in the local leagues. The default value for
    # this tag is 0, which is why it's omitted in the
    # choose_teams in the national cups.
  
    &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
    ...snip...
  
    &lt;choose_team&gt;
    &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;denmark1_short&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
    &lt;number_of_teams&gt;1&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
    &lt;randomly&gt;1&lt;/randomly&gt; &lt;/choose_team&gt;
    &lt;generate&gt;1&lt;/generate&gt;
  
    # All the other 'choose_team' elements look the
    # same.  The interesting thing is, there are 17
    # choose_teams. But note that 'england1'
    # is among the choose_teams.  The program
    # notices it if a choose_team has the same sid
    # as a league in the country and omits the
    # choose_team. Like this it's possible for
    # country_france.xml to include the cup without
    # problems; in that case, the French choose_team
    # gets omitted.
    # Now if you make some exotic definition like
    # Luxemburg, you can still include this cup; if
    # the program notices there are 17 teams instead
    # of the 16 given in &lt;overall_teams&gt;, one 
    # choose_team gets removed.
</PRE>
<P>
Let's look at the <CODE>choose_team</CODE> stuff in the
<CODE>cup_europe_uefa.xml</CODE> file:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;choose_team&gt;
    &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;LEAGUE1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  
    # The teams from the first league participate,
    # of course.
  
    &lt;number_of_teams&gt;3&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  
    # Three teams.
    
    &lt;start_idx&gt;2&lt;/start_idx&gt;
    &lt;end_idx&gt;5&lt;/end_idx&gt;
  
    # Now this is weird. Why do we start at index 2
    # and end at index 5 (which makes 4 teams) if we
    # only need 3 teams? The answer is, one of the
    # teams ranked 2nd to 4th could be the FA Cup
    # winner, which would lead to the team taking
    # part in the Cup Winners' Cup.  And we don't
    # want a team to take part in two international
    # cups.  So if e.g. the second team wins the FA
    # Cup, the 5th team would take part in the UEFA
    # Cup. (See also the notes on the order of cups
    # at the end of the country file section).
  
    &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
    &lt;choose_teams&gt;
     &lt;choose_team&gt;
    &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england1 france1 germany1_short

    # Wow! What's this? A list of string ids?
    # Yes. This is an easy way make the program load
    # a lot of teams from a lot of different
    # leagues.
  
    &lt;number_of_teams&gt;29&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  
    # We load 29 teams (which makes 32 overall
    # together with the 3 from the first league).
  
    &lt;randomly&gt;1&lt;/randomly&gt;
  
    # We load them randomly.
  
    &lt;generate&gt;1&lt;/generate&gt;
  
    # They have to be generated.
  
    &lt;/choose_team&gt; &lt;/choose_teams&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Finally, we take a look at the first <CODE>choose_team</CODE> in the Cup
Winners' Cup definition file <CODE>cup_europe_cwc.xml</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;choose_team&gt;
    &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;CUP1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  
    # Again, we have a special kind of string id,
    # telling us to get a team from the first cup in
    # the cups array.  If we play with the English country,
    # this would be the FA Cup.
  
    # ATTENTION: If the cup containing this choose_team is
    # one that gets generated at the beginning of each season
    # (which is the case here) and is not a supercup or so,
    # that's generated during a season, the cup specified in
    # the choose_team should be a national one, because the teams
    # from international cups get deleted at the end of each season.
  
    &lt;number_of_teams&gt;1&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  
    # We only need one team.
  
    &lt;start_idx&gt;1&lt;/start_idx&gt;
    &lt;end_idx&gt;2&lt;/end_idx&gt;
  
    # But the FA Cup winner could be the same team
    # that won the Premiership, and in that case the
    # team takes part in the Champions' League, so
    # we have to specify a range of two teams
    # instead of only one.
  
    # We have no 'generate' tag, because he team is
    # a league team, so the 'generate' value will be
    # the default 0 value.
  
    &lt;/choose_team&gt;

Let's have a look at all the tags relevant for <CODE>choose_teams</CODE>:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>choose_team_sid
<LI>number_of_teams
<LI>start_idx
<LI>end_idx
<LI>randomly
<LI>generate
</UL>

<P>
The <CODE>number_of_teams</CODE> is by default -1, so that all teams from
the specified league get loaded (so that the <CODE>start_idx</CODE> and
<CODE>end_idx</CODE> values aren't considered). <CODE>randomly</CODE> is by default 0,
just like <CODE>generate</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The string id can also consist of a white-space separated list of
string ids.
</P>
<P>
Two special kinds of <I>sids</I> are <CODE>LEAGUEX</CODE> and <CODE>CUPX</CODE> with
<CODE>X</CODE> being a number between 1 and the number of leagues (or cups)
in the country.
</P>
<P>
If the cup round is a knockout round and the number of teams isn't
a power of 2, as many teams get a bye as is required so that the advancing
teams and the teams with a bye make a power of 2.
</P>
<P>
If the cup round is round robin, and the number of teams isn't divisible
by the number of groups, as many teams get a bye as is required so that
the number of teams gets divisible by the number of groups.

<H3>Putting things together: cup rounds and chooose_teams</H3>
<P>
Until now it seemed that <CODE>choose_teams</CODE> and <CODE>cup_rounds</CODE> are both
equal parts of the cup definition. But the two are nested: the <CODE>choose_teams</CODE>
have to be put into the cup rounds! We've concealed the choose_team
parts of the cup rounds in the cup round section to keep things simple.
</P>
<P>
The things explained about the two structures are of course still valid.
Just don't make the error of putting the choose_teams and the cup rounds
separately.
</P>
<P>
Now let's look at some cup rounds with choose_teams included. The first
round of the UEFA Cup (<CODE>cup_europe_uefa.xml</CODE>) looks like this:
</P>
<PRE>
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;new_teams&gt;32&lt;/new_teams&gt;
  
        # This is one tag we didn't mention above because
        # it's directly related to the choose_teams.
  
        # This number has to be specified each time new
        # teams get loaded AND generated. It's the total number
        # of teams that should be taken from the choose_teams,
        # ie. local league teams are counted, too.
  
        # Here we'll have 32 teams, 3 of which come from
        # the local league 1.
  
        # If all the choose_teams refer to teams already
        # generated (e.g. if it's a national cup or a
        # supercup), this tag can be left out.
  
        &lt;choose_teams&gt;
  
  	&lt;choose_team&gt;
  	  &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;LEAGUE1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  	  &lt;number_of_teams&gt;3&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  	  &lt;start_idx&gt;2&lt;/start_idx&gt;
  	  &lt;end_idx&gt;5&lt;/end_idx&gt;
  	&lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
  	&lt;choose_team&gt;
  	  &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england1 france1 germany1_short greece1_short
  	    italy1_short netherlands1_short portugal1_short russia1_short
  	    scotland1_short spain1_short switzerland1_short turkey1_short
  	    ukraine1_short belgium1 czech1_short
  	    denmark1_short&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  	  &lt;number_of_teams&gt;29&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
  	  &lt;randomly&gt;1&lt;/randomly&gt;
  	  &lt;generate&gt;1&lt;/generate&gt;
  	&lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
        &lt;/choose_teams&gt;
  
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
  
      # What does this all mean? Well, for the first cup round
      # the above specified teams get loaded and the fixtures
      # get generated using them.    
</PRE>
<P>
Now, why should the choose_teams be part of the cup rounds? Because this way,
we can load new teams in later cup rounds. Say, you first want the teams from
weaker countries to play against each other, and then in the second cup round
the teams from the stronger countries come into play. You can simply specify
the choose_teams of the first cup round to include the weak countries, and
those of the second cup round to include the stronger ones. The teams loaded
in the second round will then play against the winners from the first round.
</P>
<P>
You only have to take care not to forget the <CODE>new_teams</CODE> tag if new teams
get actually generated (<CODE>generate</CODE> = 1 in the choose_teams) in a cup round,
and to have the appropriate number of cup rounds.
</P>
<P>
One more example from the <CODE>cup_england_league.xml</CODE> file:
</P>
<PRE>
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
        &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
  
        # Note that there is no 'new_teams' tag here. This is
        # because all teams are from leagues and don't have to
        # be generated.
  
        &lt;choose_teams&gt;
  	&lt;choose_team&gt;
  	  &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england1&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  	&lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
  	# No 'number_of_teams' tag, no start and end indices:
  	# all teams get loaded.
  
  	&lt;choose_team&gt;
  	  &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england2&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  	&lt;/choose_team&gt;
  	&lt;choose_team&gt;
  	  &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england3&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  	&lt;/choose_team&gt;
  	&lt;choose_team&gt;
  	  &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;england4&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
  	&lt;/choose_team&gt;
        &lt;/choose_teams&gt;

<H3>Promotion game cups</H3>
<P>
Promotion game cups (specified in the league definition) are
are an example of cups that only get visible to the user after
quite a few weeks in the season.
</P>
<P>
<B>Attention:</B> Even if teams from more then one league participate
in the cup, the promotion game (containing the cup <I>sid</I>) should
only be defined in one league definition file (and <B>not</B> in all
of them).
</P>
<P>
Let's have a look at the header of the
<CODE>cup_england_prom_games2.xml</CODE> file:

    &lt;short_name&gt;Prom. Gam.&lt;/short_name&gt;

    &lt;sid&gt;england_prom_games2&lt;/sid&gt;
    &lt;add_week&gt;1000&lt;/add_week&gt;
  
    # This is one of the special values (the
    # others being -1 and 0) that can be specified. This
    # means that the cup gets visible (and the fixtures
    # get written) as soon as all the leagues and cups
    # given in the choose_teams are finished.
  
    # Because of this, the 'last_week' tag is left
    # out, the cup begins in the week just after the
    # last one of the competitions given in the choose_teams
    # is finished.
  
    &lt;property&gt;national&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property&gt;highlight2&lt;/property&gt;

Note that the following tags are omitted:

<UL>
<LI>talent_diff
<LI>last_week (determined automatically)
<LI>week_gap (optional, default value 1)

Cup rounds and choose_teams are completely normal here:

    # Here we take the teams ranked 3rd to 6th from

    # specify teams from different leagues, you just
    # have to take care that the number of teams in

    # promoted and relegated. Probably you'd have to
    # use the 'prom_games_loser_sid' tag to achieve
    # this (see the league section).

    # Two cup rounds (we load 4 teams), one
    # home_away and the second on neutral ground.
  
    # Since we've given an add_week value of 1000
    # in the header part, the cup fixtures will be
    # written after the second English league is
    # finished (which is the logical thing to do,

<H3>How to create a supercup definition</H3>
<P>
A supercup is a match-up between two season winners, e.g. the
champion of the first league and the national cup or the winners
of two different cups. A supercup definition is a normal cup
definition with a few specialties. Here's the example, the
<CODE>cup_supercup_europe_uefa.xml</CODE> file:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;cup&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;UEFA Supercup&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;short_name&gt;UEFA SC&lt;/short_name&gt;
    &lt;sid&gt;supercup_europe_uefa&lt;/sid&gt;
    &lt;add_week&gt;1000&lt;/add_week&gt;
    &lt;property&gt;international&lt;/property&gt;
  
    # The general stuff. We
    # have add_week 1000; week_gap and last_week
    # are not specified, on the other hand (last_week
    # gets determined automatically, and week_gap is
    # the default 1; it isn't relevant anyway because
    # we have only one match in the cup).
  
    # You could also give a normal week number for
    # 'add_week', if you want the supercup to begin later;
    # you just have to take care that the leagues and cups
    # in the choose_teams are already finished at that
    # time of the season.
  
    &lt;cup_rounds&gt;
      &lt;cup_round&gt;
      &lt;home_away&gt;0&lt;/home_away&gt;
      &lt;neutral&gt;1&lt;/neutral&gt;

       &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;europe_champ_league&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
       &lt;number_of_teams&gt;1&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;
       &lt;start_idx&gt;1&lt;/start_idx&gt;
       &lt;end_idx&gt;1&lt;/end_idx&gt;
       &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
       # The first team is the winner of the Champions'
       # League. Take care not to
       # include the 'cup_' prefix in the sid.
  
      &lt;choose_team&gt;
      &lt;choose_team_sid&gt;europe_cwc&lt;/choose_team_sid&gt;
      &lt;number_of_teams&gt;1&lt;/number_of_teams&gt;

      &lt;end_idx&gt;1&lt;/end_idx&gt;
      &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
      # The second team is the winner of the Cup
      # Winners' Cup.  Since the teams participating
      # in the two cups are different (the cups have
      # the same 'group' value), we don't need a
      # special rule in case the same team wins both.
  
     &lt;/choose_teams&gt;
  
     &lt;/cup_round&gt;
    &lt;/cup_rounds&gt;
  
    # Only one cup round because we have only two
    # teams.
  
  &lt;/cup&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
A second, slightly more complicated example, the
<CODE>cup_supercup_league_vs_cup.xml</CODE> file. This can be used
in any country definition where there is a supercup between
the first league champion and the first cup champion.

        # We have a general string id here.
        # This tells the program to fetch the
        # winner of the first cup in the cups array (if

        &lt;/choose_team&gt;
  
        # Here we take the champion of the first league
        # in the leagues array (in 'country_england.xml'
        # that'd be the Premier League).  The important
        # thing here is that the start- and end-indices
        # specify a range of TWO teams. This doesn't
        # mean the program will load two teams from the
        # league (because number_of_teams is 1); it's
        # meant to deal with the possibility that the
        # same team wins both the league and the cup.
        # In this case the second team from the league
        # (the league runner-up) would be picked.
  
        # Of course it's possible to do things the other
        # way round. If you write the choose_team for
        # the league first, with indices 1 and 1, and
        # the cup second, with indices 1 and 2, the cup
        # runner-up gets loaded in case there is a
        # double winner.
  
      &lt;/choose_teams&gt;
  
      &lt;/cup_round&gt;
    &lt;/cup_rounds&gt;
  
    # As usual for supercups, one match on neutral
