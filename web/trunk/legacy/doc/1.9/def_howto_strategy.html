<H2>How to create a strategy definition file</H2>
<P>
A strategy definition tells a CPU team how to set up its roster before a match
and also which actions to take during a match. Rules can be made conditional with
the help of tokens, a concept also used in 
<A HREF="def_howto_lgcommentary.html">live game commentary files</A>.
</P>
<P>
The examples in the following sections are taken from
<A HREF="http://bygfoot.sf.net/misc/strategy_gy.xml">this file</A>. You may have to use the
'View source' command of your browser to prevent it from interpreting the XML tags
and producing rubbish.
</P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=5>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H3>Naming convention</H3>
<P>
The filename of a strategy file should start with <CODE>strategy_</CODE>,
followed by a unique string identifier (<I>sid</I>) and the suffix <CODE>.xml</CODE>,
e.g. <CODE>strategy_john.xml</CODE> if you're called John.
</P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=5>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H3>Header part</H3>
<P>
Here a few pieces of general information about the strategy are given:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;strategy&gt;
    &lt;sid&gt;gy&lt;/sid&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;442, balanced, best players play&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;priority&gt;1&lt;/priority&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
The root tag of strategy files is <CODE>strategy</CODE>.
<CODE>sid</CODE> is the unique string identifier. It should be the same as the part of the filename
between <CODE>strategy_</CODE> and <CODE>.xml</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>desc</CODE> is a short description of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>priority</CODE> is used in the same way as in live game commentary files.
The default value is 1 (so we could just as well leave out the tag here), and you can
use higher values to make it more probable that teams pick this strategy. If there are
two strategies, one of which has priority 1 and the other one priority 9, approximately
90% of all teams will use the second strategy.
</P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=5>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H3>Telling a team how to begin a match: prematches</H3>
<P>
In a <CODE>prematch</CODE> section we can specify which players should play in the next
match and which formation, style and boost values should be used:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;prematch&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;442&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;352&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;433&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;532&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;343&lt;/formation&gt;
  
      &lt;lineup min_fitness="75"&gt;best&lt;/lineup&gt;
      &lt;prematch_boost&gt;off&lt;/prematch_boost&gt;
      &lt;prematch_style&gt;balanced&lt;/prematch_style&gt;
    &lt;/prematch&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
The tags used are quite clear here. The reason why there are several formations instead of
only one is that some formations might be impossible to use if players are injured/banned.
In this case the next formation is tried. If all formations fail, a few players get
'repaired' so that the first formation is possible.
</P>
<P>
The formations are ordered by priority, descending, so that 442 will be taken unless it's not
possible.
</P>
<P>
Possible values for <CODE>lineup</CODE> are <CODE>best</CODE>, <CODE>weakest</CODE>, <CODE>fittest</CODE> and <CODE>unfittest</CODE>.
<CODE>min_fitness="75"</CODE> means, of course, that only players with fitness at least 75% are
taken (if possible).
</P>
<P>
Possible values for <CODE>prematch_boost</CODE> are <CODE>on</CODE>, <CODE>off</CODE> and <CODE>anti</CODE>.
Possible values for <CODE>prematch_style</CODE> are <CODE>all-out-defend</CODE>, <CODE>defend</CODE>,
<CODE>balanced</CODE>, <CODE>attack</CODE> and <CODE>all-out-attack</CODE>.
</P>

<H3>Conditional prematches</H3>
<P>
The prematch described above is the unconditional default prematch. There might be situations
in which different settings are more suitable. Because of this, several <CODE>prematch</CODE> sections
may be in a strategy file.
</P>
<P>
When picking a prematch, the program browses the prematch array in reversed order, so that the
prematch that is last in the file gets considered first. The first prematch the conditions of
which are fulfilled is then used.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, it only makes sense to have exactly one unconditional prematch at the
beginning of the file and have only conditional prematches afterwards; the latter ones should be
in reversed priority order, so that the prematch with highest priority comes last.
</P>
<P>
Conditions are used in the same way as in live game commentary files:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;prematch cond="_LAYERDIFF_ = 1 or _AVSKILLDIFF_ &lt; -8"&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;532&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;442&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;352&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;prematch_style&gt;defend&lt;/prematch_style&gt;
    &lt;/prematch&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
This means, if the opponent is one league layer higher or on average 8 points
stronger, the teams switches to defensive formation and style.
</P>
<P>
A setting that is omitted will be filled with the default value from the unconditional
default prematch; here, we've omitted <CODE>prematch_boost</CODE>, which is equivalent to specifying
<CODE>&lt;prematch_boost&gt;off&lt;/prematch_boost&gt;</CODE>, since that's the setting in the default prematch.
</P>
<P>
A list of possible tokens in conditions is at the end of this HOWTO. Tokens that express
a relation between teams, e.g. <CODE>_LAYERDIFF_</CODE>, always are calculated taking the team that
uses the strategy first. <CODE>_LAYERDIFF_ = 1</CODE> means
'this team's layer - opponent's = 1'; <CODE>_AVSKILLDIFF_ &lt; -8</CODE> means
'this team's average skill - opponent's &lt; -8'.
</P>
<P>
Let's look at some more prematches:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;prematch cond="_LAYERDIFF_ &lt; -1 or _AVSKILLDIFF_ &lt; -14"&gt;
      &lt;lineup min_fitness="75"&gt;fittest&lt;/lineup&gt;
      &lt;prematch_boost&gt;anti&lt;/prematch_boost&gt;
    &lt;/prematch&gt;
  
</PRE>
<P>
Here we assume that a team at least two league layers lower or 14 points weaker
can be beaten easily, so we take the fittest players (to give the unfit players a break)
and set boost to anti.
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;prematch cond="_GOALSTOWIN_ &gt; 2"&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;343&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;433&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;formation&gt;352&lt;/formation&gt;
      &lt;prematch_boost&gt;on&lt;/prematch_boost&gt;
      &lt;prematch_style&gt;all-out-attack&lt;/prematch_style&gt;
    &lt;/prematch&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
This is a rather important token: <CODE>_GOALSTOWIN_</CODE>. It expresses how many goals the team
must score to win a match. It also respects second-leg rules (otherwise it wouldn't make
any sense in a prematch rule). This prematch means the following: if the team has to score
more than two goals to win the match (e.g. in a second-leg match, the first leg of which
was lost 1:3 at home), we start very offensively, with boost switched on and
all-out-attacking.
</P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=5>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H3>Rules applied in the course of a match: match_actions</H3>
<P>
A match_action is -- the title says it all -- a rule applied during a match if its
conditions are fulfilled. A match_action MUST have a condition.
</P>
<P>
A match_action may change three things: the style setting of the team,
the boost setting of the team, and the lineup via a substitution.
</P>
<P>
Let's look at a few examples:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;match_action cond="_MI_ &lt; 40 and _GOALSTOWIN_ &lt; -2"&gt;
      &lt;style&gt;defend&lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/match_action&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
A really simple action. If fewer than 40 minutes are played and the team may concede 2 goals and still
wins, we switch style to defend.
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;match_action cond="_MI_ &gt;= 40 and _MI_ &lt; 65 and _GOALSTOWIN_ = 3"&gt;
      &lt;sub cond="_SUBSLEFT_ &gt; 1"&gt;
        &lt;in prop="best"&gt;forward&lt;/in&gt;
        &lt;out prop="weakest"&gt;midfielder defender&lt;/out&gt;
      &lt;/sub&gt;
      &lt;style&gt;all-out-attack&lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/match_action&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
And this is as complicated as it gets. Not very complicated, in fact.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to note is that substitution rules (enclosed in <CODE>&lt;sub&gt;</CODE> tags)
may have conditions, too. However, I can't think of any other token other than
<CODE>_SUBSLEFT_</CODE> that makes sense in the sub condition.
</P>
<P>
A substitution consists of two rules, both of which have two parts. An 'in' rule,
specifying what kind of player should come into the match, and an 'out' rule,
telling the program which player gets substituted.
</P>
<P>
The attribute <CODE>prop</CODE> means 'property' and can be one of <CODE>best</CODE>, <CODE>weakest</CODE>,
<CODE>fittest</CODE> and <CODE>unfittest</CODE>. The <CODE>&lt;in&gt;</CODE> tags itself may contain a player
position: <CODE>goalie</CODE>, <CODE>defender</CODE>, <CODE>midfielder</CODE> or <CODE>forward</CODE>. The <CODE>&lt;out&gt;</CODE>
tag may contain a list of positions. If more than one position is given, the program
picks the position that the most players on the pitch have. If there are 5 defenders and
3 midfielders, the rule would substitute a forward for a defender. If there are
3 defenders and 5 midfielders, a midfielder gets substituted.
</P>
<P>
Of course, this mainly makes sense with midfielders and defenders, since there are
almost always fewer forwards on the pitch than either (and it would be insane to
include a goalie in the list, too).
</P>
<P>
Finally, we have a look at another match_action:
</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;match_action cond="_MI_ &gt;= 40 and _MI_ &lt; 65 and _GOALSTOWIN_ &gt; 3"&gt;
      &lt;sub cond="_SUBSLEFT_ &gt; 1"&gt;
        &lt;in prop="fittest"&gt;midfielder&lt;/in&gt;
        &lt;out prop="unfittest"&gt;midfielder defender&lt;/out&gt;
      &lt;/sub&gt;
      &lt;style&gt;balanced&lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;boost&gt;anti&lt;/boost&gt;
    &lt;/match_action&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
This means, if between 40 and 65 minutes are played and we can concede 3 goals and
still win, we switch style to balanced, boost to anti (to rest the players a bit)
and substitute the unfittest midfielder for a fresh player.
</P>
<P>
Match_actions should be ordered reversed by priority, so the most important ones should be
at the end of the file.

<H2>How to test a strategy definition file</H2>
<P>
Now you've written your strategy file, you should test it. To do so, you have
to place the file in the subdir <CODE>strategy</CODE> of the <B>primary</B> support directory.
</P>
<P>
Which one is that? It depends on what kind of <B>Bygfoot</B> package you're using:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>If you use the CVS version (and start <B>Bygfoot</B> with <CODE>./src/bygfoot</CODE>) or the 
  binary version (and start with <CODE>./bygfoot</CODE>), the primary support dir is
  <CODE>./support_files</CODE>, so you have to copy your <CODE>strategy_john.xml</CODE> file into
  <CODE>./support_files/strategy</CODE>.
<P></P>
<LI>If you use an installed version (an RPM, or a source/CVS version you called <CODE>make install</CODE> on)
  and call <B>Bygfoot</B> from somewhere <B>without</B> an existing <CODE>./support_dir</CODE> subdirectory,
  the primary support directory is <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot-1.9/</CODE> or <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot-cvs/</CODE> if you use
  the CVS version. Thus you have to place your file in <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot-1.9/strategy</CODE> or
  <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot-cvs/strategy</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Now your strategy automatically gets loaded and used by a certain number of teams in new games
(the number depending on the priority of your strategy file relative the the priorities of the
rest of the strategies).
</P>
<P>
A minor problem is, how do you find out which teams use your strategy? The solution is to start the
game with a debug level &gt;= 50. This will make the program display the strategy sids in brackets after
the team names in the tables view and in the team browse mode.
</P>
<P>
To start the game with a debug level, you call <CODE>bygfoot -d LEVEL</CODE>. Debug level &gt;= 50 also has the
advantage that your players don't get injured or banned and their fitness doesn't decrease, either,
so you can play a quick season without having to manage your team.
</P>
<P>
You can also change the debug level in-game by right-clicking on the CLOSE button in the toolbar
and immediately afterwards middle-clicking on it. This will pop up the debug window, where you
enter <CODE>debNUM</CODE>, NUM being your desired debug level. Here you can also enter <CODE>gotoWEEK</CODE>
(only recommended after setting the debug level to &gt;= 50) to let the game calculate results
and skip weeks without user interference until the given week is reached.
</P>
<P>
To cut a long story short: to see how good or bad your strategy is, you start the game with debug=50,
check the tables to make sure your strategy gets used by some teams, popup the debug window and
'fast forward' 20 or 30 weeks, and check the tables to see whether your strategy rocks or sucks.
