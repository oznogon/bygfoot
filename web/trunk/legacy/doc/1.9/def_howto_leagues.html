<H2>How to create a league definition file</H2>
<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H3>General info</H3>
<P>
This is a lot more complicated than creating a country file,
unfortunately.  Let's have a look at the example
<CODE>league_england3.xml</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;league&gt;
  
    &lt;sid&gt;england3&lt;/sid&gt;
  
    # This one we already know.
  
    &lt;name&gt;Football League One&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;short_name&gt;F. L. One&lt;/short_name&gt;
  
    # The short name which can be used in the
    # program when there isn't a lot of room for a
    # long name.
  
    &lt;symbol&gt;flag_en.png&lt;/symbol&gt;
  
    &lt;first_week&gt;1&lt;/first_week&gt;
  
    # The first week there are matches in the
    # league.  Normally this is 1, but if you prefer
    # all leagues to have their last matchday in the
    # same week you can adjust their starting weeks
    # however you like.
  
    &lt;week_gap&gt;1&lt;/week_gap&gt;
  
    # The number of weeks between matchdays. For
    # leagues this is normally 1.
  
    &lt;average_talent&gt;6000&lt;/average_talent&gt;
  
    # The average talent in the league IN PERCENTAGE
    # OF THE MAXIMUM SKILL as given in the constants
    # file.  See the 'bygfoot_constants' file.
    # Since floats are given as integers in our
    # definition files, in this example the teams
    # will have average talents of about 60% of the
    # maximum skill (which is currently 99).
  
    &lt;names_file&gt;england&lt;/names_file&gt;
  
    # The sid of the player names file to use.
    # In this case the names of most players in
    # the league will get loaded from the file
    # 'player_names_england.xml' which contains
    # English first names and last names.
  
    # See also the section about names files.
  
  ...snip...
  
  &lt;/league&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
One tag that's not mentioned is <CODE>&lt;yellow_red&gt;</CODE>. This one takes an
integer value; it signifies the number of yellow cards in the
league after which a player gets banned automatically for a
week. In the English leagues there isn't such a rule, so the
tag's missing above (which leads to a default value of 1000 when
the definition file gets loaded), but in the German Bundesliga
the value would be 5, for instance.
</P>
<P>
Another tag that won't be used in most of the leagues is <CODE>&lt;round_robins&gt;</CODE>.
This specifies how many round robins are played (a round robin meaning only
ONE match for each team versus each other team); in most leagues this is 2,
which is also the default value, but in leagues with only a few teams,
eg. the Austrian league or the Scottish one, during a league championships
a team play four times or so against each of the other teams, so you'd specify
4 (in fact for the Scottish league it's 3).
</P>
<P>
If you want to have a custom break between round robins (instead of the default
value <CODE>week_gap</CODE>, that's 1 for most leagues), you can write
<CODE>&lt;break&gt;3&lt;/break&gt;</CODE>, for instance. This will cause each round robin to start
3 weeks later than the end of the previous one.
</P>
<P>
A third tag not mentioned is <CODE>layer</CODE>. This gives the 'depth' of the league,
where the first league has layer 1, the leagues directly below the first league
have layer 2 etc. This plays a role in countries with parallel leagues, e.g.
in the German country file there is a first league, a second league and two
parallel third leagues. By default, the layer value of a league is its index in
the leagues array + 1. In the German definitions a layer value of 3 is given
for the two parallel third leagues; the other leagues get the default values
1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to use a league only to be able to have some teams in the
definition, and don't want the league to be visible or league matches to
be scheduled and played, you can use the <CODE>inactive</CODE> property
(<CODE>&lt;property&gt;inactive&lt;/property&gt;</CODE>). This is used in the World Cup definition, for
instance, where there are no leagues as such, only cups.
</P>

<H3>Promotion and relegation</H3>
<P>
Let's look at how promotion and relegation is managed. We are
still in the `league_england3.xml` file.
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;league&gt;
  
  ...snip...
  
    &lt;prom_rel&gt;
  
    # The beginning tag of the promotion and
    # relegation section.
  
      &lt;prom_games&gt;
  
    # This is a specialty of English leagues (as far
    # as I know): at the end of a season a couple of
    # teams that haven't finished at the very top,
    # eg.  those ranked 4th to 7th play a cup
    # (eg. two rounds of knock-out, if we have 4
    # teams) and the winner(s) gets promoted (this
    # of course only holds in lower leagues, not
    # Premiership).
  
        &lt;prom_games_dest_sid&gt;england2&lt;/prom_games_dest_sid&gt;
  
         # The string id of the league the advancing
         # teams get promoted to.
  
         # It's also possible to give a space-separated
         # list of league sids. In that case, the teams
         # get moved alternately and randomly to the leagues
         # specified (the number of teams should be divisible
         # by the number of sids, of course). See also the
         # section below.
  
         # One possible tag not used here is
         # &lt;prom_games_loser_sid&gt; which would tell
         # the program to move all teams
         # participating in the promotion games that
         # are not among the first
         # 'number_of_advance' (see below) to the
         # league with the specified string id. You can give
         # a space-separated list of sids here, too.
  
        &lt;prom_games_number_of_advance&gt;1&lt;/prom_games_number_of_advance&gt;
  
        # How many teams advance to the destination
        # league.
        # The default value is 1, so you can leave out this
        # tag if only the winner of the cup gets promoted.
  
        &lt;prom_games_cup_sid&gt;england_prom_games3&lt;/prom_games_cup_sid&gt;
  
        # The string id of the cup that determines
        # the cup format.  Note that the
        # choose_teams in the cup definition should
        # only feature league teams.
  
        # This cup has to be part of the cups array
        # in the country definition.
        
        # See the cup howto section on how to define
        # a cup.
  
      &lt;/prom_games&gt;
      
  
      &lt;prom_rel_element&gt;
  
      # An element describing the movement of a
      # range of teams from the league to another
      # one.
  
        &lt;rank_start&gt;1&lt;/rank_start&gt;
  
        # The beginning of the range (referring to
        # the rank of the teams in the table at the
        # end of the season).
  
        &lt;rank_end&gt;2&lt;/rank_end&gt;
  
        # The end of the range. The two values are
        # INCLUSIVE.
  
        &lt;dest_sid&gt;england2&lt;/dest_sid&gt;
  
        # The string id of the league the teams get
        # moved to. Space-separated list of sids is
        # allowed, too.
  
        &lt;prom_rel_type&gt;promotion&lt;/prom_rel_type&gt;
  
        # The type of the element: either
        # 'promotion' or 'relegation' or
        # 'none'. This is only important to
        # determine the background colours in the
        # table.
  
        
        # So in this element describes the promotion
        # of the first two teams to the league with
        # id 'england2' (which should be described
        # in the file 'league_england2.xml').
  
      &lt;/prom_rel_element&gt;
  
  
      &lt;prom_rel_element&gt;
  
      # This element describes the relegation of the
      # last 4 teams to the league 'england4'.  The
      # only differences to the above element...
  
        &lt;rank_start&gt;21&lt;/rank_start&gt;
        &lt;rank_end&gt;24&lt;/rank_end&gt;
        &lt;dest_sid&gt;england4&lt;/dest_sid&gt;
  
        # ...are the destination league (the one
        # below the current one, and...
  
        &lt;prom_rel_type&gt;relegation&lt;/prom_rel_type&gt;
  
        # ...the type: relegation.
  
      &lt;/prom_rel_element&gt;
  
   &lt;/prom_rel&gt;
  
  ...snip...
  
  &lt;/league&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
A note concerning parallel leagues: in a lot of countries
there are lower leagues which are parallel, in the sense
that teams from the leagues get promoted or relegated to the
same league. Say we have league 1 and leagues 2a and 2b; two
teams from league 1 get relegated, and the champions of 2a
and 2b get promoted. Now with the above syntax we could
specify that the last team from league 1 gets moved to 2a
and the last-but-one to 2b. This would work fine, but if you
play 20 seasons, league 2b will be stronger than 2a,
because it always got a slightly better team added from
league 1. The solution is to specify only ONE
prom_rel_element in league 1 and give two dest_sids. The
following example is taken from <CODE>league_belgium2.xml</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE>
  &lt;prom_rel_element&gt;
  	&lt;rank_start&gt;17&lt;/rank_start&gt;
  	&lt;rank_end&gt;18&lt;/rank_end&gt;
  	&lt;dest_sid&gt;belgium3a belgium3b&lt;/dest_sid&gt;
  
  	# This is the important part. Two dest_sids are
          # given. The resulting relegation will happen
          # randomly, so at times the last team will move to
          # belgium3b and the last-but-one to belgium3a, and
          # sometimes the other way round.
  	# As long as the number of teams moved is divisible
          # by the number of sids, the number of teams moved
          # to each league is the same. So specifying four
          # teams and two sids would work too, each of the two
          # leagues would receive two random teams.
  	
  	&lt;prom_rel_type&gt;relegation&lt;/prom_rel_type&gt;
  &lt;/prom_rel_element&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
So to conclude, promotion and relegation is managed by these
prom_rel_elements which allow arbitrary movement of ranges of
teams after a season across different leagues.  All leagues that
occur in an element should be part of the country definition, of
course.
</P>
<P>
A special form of promotion/relegation are the promotion games.
</P>
<P>
The important tags we've seen in this section were:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>prom_games_dest_sid
<LI>prom_games_loser_sid
<LI>prom_games_number_of_advance
<LI>prom_games_cup_sid
<LI>prom_rel_element
<LI>rank_start
<LI>rank_end
<LI>dest_sid
<LI>prom_rel_type
</UL>

<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H3>Teams</H3>
<P>
The last part of the league definition consists of the
teams. Currently there are four tags for teams:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>team_name</CODE> gives the name of the team
<LI>[optional] <CODE>team_symbol</CODE> gives a symbol for the team. If unspecified,
   the team gets the symbol of the league.
<LI>[optional] <CODE>team_average_talent</CODE> gives the average talent of the players
  in the team. If unspecified, the team gets more or less the average
  talent of the league.
<LI>[optional] <CODE>team_names_file</CODE> gives the file the player names get loaded
  from (see the <CODE>names_file</CODE> tag for leagues).
<LI>[optional] <CODE>def_file</CODE> gives a team definition file that contains additional
  information (see the howto about <A HREF="def_howto_teams.html">team definitions</A>).
  The information in the def file overwrites the info given in the
  previous tags.
</UL>

<PRE>
  &lt;league&gt;
  
  ...snip...
  
    &lt;teams&gt;
  
    # Starting tag for the team list.
  
      &lt;team&gt;
  
      # A team!
  
        &lt;team_name&gt;Barnsley&lt;/team_name&gt;
  
       # The team name. 
  
      &lt;/team&gt;
       &lt;team&gt;
  	&lt;team_name&gt;Blackpool&lt;/team_name&gt;
  	&lt;team_symbol&gt;team_england_blackpool.png&lt;/team_symbol&gt;
       &lt;/team&gt;
  
       # A team with an image file.
  
  ...snip...
  
    &lt;/teams&gt;
  
  &lt;/league&gt;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H3>Official team names</H3>
<P>
League definitions may not contain official team names like
Real Madrid or Manchester United, only R. Madrid and Manchester
(or Manchester U.).
</P>
<P>
However, you can make a file with official names that can be
downloaded with the <CODE>bygfoot-update</CODE> script and used to patch
the def files with unofficial names.
The official names file should have a format like this:
</P>
<PRE>
  League: country
  	inofficial name: official name
  	inofficial name: official name
  	inofficial name: official name
  	inofficial name: official name
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
<CODE>country</CODE> should be the common part of the sids of the country's leagues,
e.g. <CODE>england</CODE> (the english league files are called league_england1.xml
to league_england5.xml, remember?).
</P>
<P>
The inofficial name should be the name used in the league definition file,
e.g. R. Madrid. Take care to copy the names exactly, otherwise they won't
get replaced by the official names.
</P>
<P>
The official names are the real names of the clubs, e.g. Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
You can have a look at the current official names file
