<P>
<OL>
<LI>Do new players ever appear in the game?
<P>
Yes. Each week a handful of players 
in CPU teams are replaced by new ones.
<P>
<LI>Do the players with numbers 12-20 influence the outcome of a game?
<P>
No. Only 
the field players.
<P>
<LI>What happens if a player gets sent off in the first (cup) game of a week?
<P>
In
 the first game, players never get sent off or injured. I might change this 
 some day, if I implement substitutions after game 1.
<P>
<LI>Do players get yellow cards in cup games?
<P>
No. Otherwise it could happen
that they get their 5th yellow card, which would automatically lead to a red 
card.
<P>
<LI>Do players have a real talent value, or only this 'estimated talent' thing?
<P>
They
have a real talent value which never changes. Their development when they're 
young depends on their talent value, as well as their peak skill. But of 
course you only see your scout's estimate of this value.
<P>
<LI>How precisely do scouts estimate the talent value of a player?
<P>
The best scout's estimate has an error up to 1.0 points, i.e. he might 
think a player with 7.0 talent has talent 8 (or 6). But this is the maximum 
error, he'll estimate better normally. The other scouts' errors are 2, 3 
and 4 points.
<P>
<LI>What is the second value after team skill average?
<P>
The first value is the average current skill of the first 11 players 
(i.e. those who'll count when you play a match). The second value is 
the average cskill value of all your players.
<P>
<LI>How does playing style and team structure influence the playing 
strength of my team?
<P>
Each team has an attacking and defending value. If you have 
structure 532, i.e. five defenders but only two forwards, your defending value 
is rather high, because the defenders cskill is weighted much more 
for defense than the cskill of your forwards. Accordingly your attacking 
value is rather low because the cskill of your defenders has only a small 
weight for your offense. Midfielders' cskills are weighted equally for 
defense and offense. Now if you have playing style 'Attack', the defending 
value is diminished, and the attacking value is increased (symmetrically,
e.g. -5% and +5%). If you have 'All Out Attack', the defending value
is diminished even more and the attacking value is increased even
more.
<P>
<LI>How do players improve? When does their skill reach their top talent value?
<P>
Young players improve best if they play often and stay healthy. 
If they play approximately every 3 weeks and stay healthy, they improve
about every 14-15 weeks. Old players' skill gets worse no matter if
they play or not; it gets worse even faster if they're injured.
It might happen that a player never reaches his talent value if he's
injured often. But on average field players reach their highest skill
approx. at the age of 31-32. Goalies 1 or 2 years later.
<P>
<LI>Does switching live game on or off influence the performance of my team?
<P>
In short: no. The 'live game' isn't really live, the result's already 
computed before the game is shown.
<P>
<LI>How can a team score twice within a fraction of a second in a live game?
<P>
The live game shows 90+ minutes within 20 or 30 seconds, so 1 match
minute means only 0.3 seconds in reality. If a team scores twice
within a match minute, this leads to two goals in the live game within
less than a second; and the tendency bar simply doesn't have time to
move to center position.
<P>
<LI>Is there any advantage of having a scout after the transfer deadline?
<P>
No. 
If you're short on money, fire him. 
<P>
<LI>Why are there sometimes two matches a week?
<P>
There are simply too many 
matches to have each week only one. But perhaps I'll implement substituting 
players after the first one, at least.
<P>
<LI>How does fitness influence the performance of players in matches?
<P>
Not very much. An 8.0 player with fitness 80% still performs a
little bit better than a 7.5 player with fitness 99%. 
<P>
<LI>How does fitness influence the probability to get injured?
<P>
The injury 
probability is inversely proportional to the fitness value. 
A player with fitness 50% has twice the probability of getting injured 
compared to a 99% player. However, if you take just one player, the
probability's still small, about 3% (with fitness 50%). But if all of
your players have low fitness, one of them will probably get injured.
