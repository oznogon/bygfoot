<H2>The "Text Files"</H2>
<P>
There are two possible ways (up to now) to customise <B>Bygfoot</B>: writing team 
definitions and writing country files. Both ways involve editing text files but
the non technically minded user can, nevertheless do it without much hassle, as 
we are going to see.
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> currently uses two main text files to store definitions: the <CODE>teams</CODE>
file (where team data are stored) and the <CODE>country_XXX</CODE> files (where data about
the leagues are stored).
<P>
By editing the <CODE>teams</CODE> file you can create or modify the available teams.
<P>
By editing the or creating <CODE>country_XXX</CODE> files you can modify the existing leagues
or add new ones.
<P>
<a name="toc2"></a>
<H2>The File Formats</H2>
<P>
<B>Bygfoot</B> text files are UTF-8-encoded. The reason for this is to make it possible
to show the names of teams and players from most countries using all international
characters needed. UTF-8 currently supports all alphabetical scripts and a large deal
of CJK (When is someone going to send us Russian, Egyptian, Indian or Georgian country
files so that we demonstrate this better? ;-).
<P>
Using UTF-8 is, however, quite a nuisance because it is not easy to type in it without
a suitable text editor. If your editor doesn't support UTF-8 you may either load the
file with lots of empty boxes in the places of non-ASCII characters or have it automatically
converted to your locale encoding. So, if you edit a <B>Bygfoot</B> text file by hand you 
must take care that your editor doesn't mess up the encoding. 
<P>
The easiest way to overcome  any encoding mess is to use the ubiquitious <CODE>iconv</CODE> 
command (available everywhere a  <CODE>glibc</CODE> is fully installed, i.e. all Linux, Unix and 
BSD flavours).
<P>
To decode a UTF-8 file to your locale encoding (for instance Western
European), use this:
<P>
<PRE>
  iconv -f utf-8 -t iso8859-15 [file]
</PRE>
<P>
To convert back into unicode, use this:
<P>
<PRE>
  iconv -f iso8859-15 -t utf-8 [file]
</PRE>
<P>
You can also use <CODE>recode</CODE> (not so usually available): 
<P>
<PRE>
  recode UTF-8..ISO-8859-1 country_eng
</PRE>
<P>
But the best way to prevent this from happening is to use a text
editor that understands UTF-8. A text editor that doesn't mix up the 
UTF-encoding is <A HREF="http://www.yudit.org">yudit</A>. We strongly recommend it,
although it is not a programmer's tool.
<P>
<a name="toc3"></a>
<H2>Editing Teams</H2>
<P>
You can start the Team Editor from the team selection window at startup
or by calling Bygfoot with one of the "-e" or "--editor" command-line 
switches.
<P>
At startup, the game looks only for teams with names that are in the
list of the league teams (i.e. among the first 114 in the country
file, in other words those you can choose from at the beginning) in
the definitions file. Because of this it doesn't make sense to specify
a team with a name that's not in one of the country files.
<P>
If you'd like to edit the definitions file directly, see the comments
in the file. And take care that you don't mix up the encoding.
<P>
<a name="toc4"></a>
<H3>The Team Editor interface</H3>
<P>
Upon starting the Team Editor you will see a window containing the
following elements, from the top to the bottom:
<P>
<DL>
<DT>Team definitions file</DT><DD> the file the teams are being
currently read from and written to.
<P>
<B>Attention:</B> <B>Bygfoot</B> looks at startup only for
team definitions in <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot/text_files/teams</CODE>,
so it doesn't really make sense to change the name of
the definitions file if you want to use it normally with <B>Bygfoot</B>.
<P>
<DT>Country file</DT><DD> the file from which the team list is read. Only teams
listed in this country file will be available for editing.
<P>
<DT>Teams in the country file</DT><DD> the list of the teams you can choose
from.
<P>
<DT>Team structures, Average skills</DT><DD> see below.
<P>
<DT>Players' list</DT><DD> The list of players of a team. If a player isn't yet edited,
his name field reads "# NOBODY".
<P>
<DT>Player editing fields, Player moving buttons, Function buttons</DT><DD>
  Self-explanatory. See also below.
</DL>
<a name="toc5"></a>
<H3>Editing/Creating a team</H3>
You have to specify three things to be able to edit a team:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Team definitions file. Already edited teams are read from this file 
and newly-edited teams get written to it (by default).
<LI>Country file. Any team you create is automatically assigned to the
country file that is selected when you edit it.
<LI>Team name.
</OL>
<B>Tip:</B> If you want to change the names of quite a lot of teams, you should
consider creating your own custom country file (see below).
<P>
<B>Attention:</B> Before choosing another team, you have to save the changes 
you've made with the <CODE>Save</CODE> button. Otherwise they are lost.
<P>
<a name="toc6"></a>
<H3>Structures</H3>
<P>
"Structure" is the way the players get distributed while playing. You must be
used to hearing commentators mention the most widely-adopted ones: 4-4-2, 
3-5-2, 4-3-3 and 4-5-1. Those of you not much acquainted with football (I mean, 
Americans, Aussies, New Zealanders, Canadians and Indians), please notice that
these numbers mean the amount of defenders, midfielders and forwards. Notice also
that the goal-keepers (a.k.a. "goalies") are not counted in the structure.
<P>
Those not much acquainted with football should read the "Overview" section
of the documentation before playing or editing.
<P>
The first structure value specifies the distribution of the players that will take
part in the game, the second specifies the positions of the other players in your
team. In short: by choosing these numbers you are saying how much players of each
position your team will have.
<P>
Players #1 and #12 are always goalies.
<P>
To change the position of a player, you either have to swap him with another player 
using the "Swap" button or change the team structure. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Example:</B> you want player 18 to be a forward, additionally to players 19 and 20. 
<LI><B>Solution:</B> you set the second structure to 233 or 323. 
</UL>
<a name="toc7"></a>
<H3>Skill</H3>
<P>
The average skill spinbutton shows you the average skill of all players 
(except the "nobodies"). If you'd like to increase or decrease the skills of all 
players simultaneously, you can use this button.
<P>
This button is the one to be used to determine the level of the team you are
editing, so that your "Real Madrid" won't be a lot weaker than your "Rayo Vallecano".
<P>
Notice that <B>Bygfoot</B> uses four Skill values:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Current Skill (Cskill): is the skill the player is able to use right now. It exist
because  you can put a player in a position other than his best.
<LI>Skill: is the skill the player has "nowadays" (in the game).
<LI>Estimated Talent (Etal): is the estimation (made by your scout) of the player's ability
in his peak.
<LI>Talent: is the real ability the player can reach. This value is hidden (the game uses
it but you never know it).
</OL>
<a name="toc8"></a>
<H3>Editing a player</H3>
<P>
This is quite straightforward. After selecting a player by clicking on his row, you can 
edit his name, skill, talent and birth date. You can also move him up or down in the 
list and swap him with another player.
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Skill</B> is the "real skill" the player will start with.
<LI><B>Talent</B> is the potential skill the player may reach someday (or the maximum skill
he may have reached in the past) when in his peak.
<LI><B>Birth Year</B> and <B>Month</B> are used by the game to update the player's age.
</OL>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> <B>Bygfoot</B> uses real time to determine the player's ages. So, as time goes
by, your teams get really old (even if you don't play with them) because the ages are
determined by comparison of the data written to the team file and the current system
date.
<P>
To avoid problems with this (e.g. if you edit Zidane, who's already 33 or so, which is rather
old for <B>Bygfoot</B>, you won't have much fun with him because he probably gets worse immediately),
user-edited players get worse no earlier than 1 or 2 years after you begin to play with them.
Of course this could lead to quite absurd player development, so i might change this in some
later version.
<P>
<B>WARNING:</B> You have to click the "Update player information" button for the changes 
to take effect before you edit another player, otherwise they are lost.
<P>
<a name="toc9"></a>
<H3>Finishing</H3>
When you're done with editing, you have a these possibilities:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>discard the changes you've made and play the game,
<LI>save the changes and play,
<LI>save the changes and quit,
<LI>export the edited team to an individual file (see naming convention below)
</UL>
<a name="toc10"></a>
<H2>Managing teams</H2>
<P>
From inside the Team Editor you can import or export team definitions 
into standalone text files. This feature is intended to allow users to 
exchange team definitions, which is a quicker way to extend the game than 
expecting someone to write all team definitions.
<P>
However, the Team Editor was not intended to be THE tool to manage the 
teams file (although it is the easiest one). You can also use UTF-8 
enabled text editors to do so because the <CODE>teams</CODE> file is only a plain
text file encoded in UTF-8.
<P>
<a name="toc11"></a>
<H3>Team definition files</H3>
<P>
The default team definitions file is <CODE>$HOME.bygfoot/text_files/teams</CODE>. 
If you don't want to touch it, you can specify another one or create a new one;
you have to keep in mind, though, that <B>Bygfoot</B> only reads team definitions 
from the <CODE>$HOME/.bygfoot/text_files/teams</CODE> or the
<CODE>$PREFIX/support_files/text_files/teams</CODE> files.
<P>
Writing all teams to a definitions file with a different name can be useful if 
you'd like to exchange definitions files with someone else, but it is a better 
idea to export individual teams to files.
<P>
You can't edit a team that's not in a country file because all team names in 
the game get read from it. But of course you can change a team name to anything 
you like with the editor. 
<P>
Additionally, if you'd like to add all teams in an existing definitions file 
to you definitions file, you can use the "Import" feature.
Importing a file basically means that all team definitions found in the 
specified file are appended to your definitions file.
<P>
If you'd like to export the currently edited team to a file, click on the 
"Export" button and choose a filename.
<P>
<a name="toc12"></a>
<H3>Exchanging teams</H3>
<P>
Exchanging team definitions with others is really simple. If you've edited a 
team you're proud of, and you'd like to share it with other <B>Bygfoot</B> users, 
export the team to a new file, say <CODE>ManchesterUnited.John</CODE>. All your friend Paul 
has to do now is start the <B>Editor</B>, click on "Import", select the file he 
received from you, and John's Manchester United is added to Paul's definitions file.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> If there's a team with the same name (in this case, Manchester 
United) in Paul's definitions file, importing John's file kind of overrides 
Paul's definition of ManU, because the last definition in the file counts.
<P>
An even simpler possibility (for the technically-minded) to import a file 
would be to <CODE>cat</CODE> it to the  definitions file:
<P>
<PRE>
  cat ManchesterUnited.John &gt;&gt; /home/paul/.bygfoot/text_files/teams
</PRE>
<P>
This can also be done using the <CODE>less</CODE> command:
<P>
<PRE>
  less a_team &gt;&gt; teams
</PRE>
<P>
There will be a collection of standalone teams <A HREF="../extras.html">here</A> that you will
be able to play with.
<P>
<a name="toc13"></a>
<H3>Managing team definitions</H3>
<P>
As all team definitions are stored to a single text file, it can happen that this
file will someday become too big. The Team Editor does not currently include any
facility to manage this.  So,  if it happens, you will have to open the teams file
in a text editor and remove those teams you don't want any more.
<P>
It can happen also that a same team will be defined there two or more times. In this
case <B>Bygfoot</B> will always used the one that appears last in the teams file but 
the garbage data will inflate the file unnecessarily. If you accidentally import 
a team that you don't like, open the teams file and delete it before importing another
one. However, there is no harm in "Importing" teams from files if you don't save
them. So, you can browse a collection of teams and choose those you want and those
you don't want.
<P>
It is a good idea to keep backup copies of the teams you like most somewhere
safe. Whenever something goes wrong -- or if you need to delete your <CODE>~/.bygfoot</CODE> dir --
you will be able to recover them.
<P>
When exporting teams to standalone files, be careful to use a sensible naming convention
so that, when you exchange them with others, people will be able to keep track of what
is the content of the files. We, from the <B>Bygfoot</B> development team, would like you all 
to use this scheme:
<P>
<CODE>XXX_Y_teamname_year_contributor_version.btd.gz</CODE>
<P>
Which means:
<P>
<DL>
<DT>XXX</DT><DD> the country the team plays in, in iso three-letter format (eng, bra, esp, ita, etc.).
<DT>Y</DT><DD> the league the team is in, e.g. 1 for the best league
<DT>teamname</DT><DD> a name by which your team will be easily recognised, say "realmadrid".
<DT>year</DT><DD> the year you wrote the file definition, so that people know whether your definition
is still valid.
<DT>contributor</DT><DD> a nickname by which you want us to refer to you (we may want to group
definitions by contributors).
<DT>version</DT><DD> if you update the file within the same year. Initial version is not indicated. Further
versions should be numbered by "a", "b", "c", etc.
<DT>btd</DT><DD> is the file extension you should use so that you know that this file is a **Bygfoot
Team Definition** -- this is useful because they are, after all, only plain text files.
<DT>gz</DT><DD> is because you might want to compress the files to save space or bandwidth.
</DL>
An example:
<P>
<PRE>
  bra_1_atleticomineiro_2004_jggouvea_b.btd.gz
</PRE>
<P>
Which means a bra(zilian) team named "atleticomineiro", in the first brazilian league,
as it was in 2004, as written by one "jggouvea". This is the second revision he made that year.
<P>
<a name="toc14"></a>
<H2>Writing country files</H2>
<P>
Country files contain team names, league names and cup names. Each
time you select another flag when you're asked to choose a team at the
beginning of the game, a new country file is loaded. 
<P>
The simplest way to make a new country file would be to copy one of
the existing ones and edit it.
<P>
The default country files contain a lot of comments, so you don't
really have to read the description below.
<P>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> If you want to submit a country file to us, don't remove
all those comments: they're useful for the newbies. You are even 
encouraged to translate them to country's language.
<P>
<a name="toc15"></a>
<H3>Structure</H3>
<P>
A country file is divided into the following sections
<P>
<DL>
<DT>Preamble</DT><DD> Some blah-blah useful for newbies.
<DT>Team List</DT><DD> consists of 114 newline-separated team names; these will take part 
in the 5 national leagues.
<DT>List of Foreign Teams</DT><DD> consists of 16 blocks of team names, each block 
identified by a number instead of a name. Each team must
be on a line of its own. From these blocks the teams participating in the 
international cups (Champions' League etc.) are loaded.
<DT>League and cup names</DT><DD> (e.g. "Premier Division" for England, "Primera División"
for Spain).
</DL>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B> Please do not use the official team names of your
  country, e.g. "Real Madrid", because it is illegal without a license
  (which <B>Bygfoot</B> doesn't have, of course). Use city names and perhaps
  abbreviations instead, e.g. "R. Madrid".
<P>
The Preamble must have all lines commented (if you don't understand this,
don't touch it!). It contains some generic info supposed to be helpful to 
teach newbies how to edit a country file.
<P>
The Team list MUST be ended by a line reading "1000".
<P>
<a name="toc16"></a>
<H3>Managing Country Files</H3>
<P>
If you write a country file, please be gentle enough to translate the comments
in the file to that country's language -- if you can. You are even encouraged to
translate country files you have not written: if you come across a country
file whose comments are not yet translated to the country's language, please do 
the translation and send the file back to us.
<P>
When writing country files, be careful to use a sensible naming convention. This
naming convention is supposed to help us keep track of who wrote what and when.
We, the <B>Bygfoot</B> development team, would like you all to use this scheme:
<P>
<CODE>country_XXX_year_contributor_version.gz</CODE>
<P>
Which means:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>country: the word "country". ;-)
<LI>XXX: the three-letter ISO code for a given country ("arg", "usa", "jpn").
<LI>year: the year that country file corresponds to (supposed to be the current
year when the file was written or would someone wish to write a country file
reflecting the classifications of the Italian leagues of 1969?).
<LI>contributor: a nickname by which we should call you (please don't use a nickname
that has already been taken by someone else).
<LI>version: if you are updating a previous contribution, use letters to indicate 
this.
</UL>
An example:
<P>
<PRE>
  country_ita_2004_vicenzototti_a.gz
</PRE>
<P>
Which means that this file is for Italy, was written in 2004 by someone who wishes 
us to call him "vicenzototti" and is the second version (a) of the Italian file
he wrote.
